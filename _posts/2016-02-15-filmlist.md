<p>In 2005, scientists discover an extrasolar planet, which they name Planet G, believed to have <a href="/wiki/Habitable_zone" title="Habitable zone" class="mw-redirect">conditions nearly identical to Earth</a>. In 2006, <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> built a transmission device in <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> that is five times more powerful than any before it, and a program to contact the planet began; it was known as "The Beacon Project". Meanwhile, slacker Alex Hopper gets arrested while attempting to impress Sam Shane, daughter of <a href="/wiki/Commander,_U.S._Pacific_Fleet" title="Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet">U.S. Pacific Fleet commander</a> <a href="/wiki/Admiral_(United_States)" title="Admiral (United States)">Admiral</a> Terrance Shane. Infuriated at Alex's lack of motivation, Stone Hopper, Alex's older brother and a naval officer, forces him to also sign up for the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Navy" title="U.S. Navy" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Navy</a>.</p>
<p>In 2012, Alex is a hothead and disrespectful <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_(navy)" title="Lieutenant (navy)">lieutenant</a> and Tactical Action Officer aboard the <a href="/wiki/Arleigh_Burke-class_destroyer" title="Arleigh Burke-class destroyer"><i>Arleigh Burke</i>-class destroyer</a> <a href="/wiki/USS_John_Paul_Jones_(DDG-53)" title="USS John Paul Jones (DDG-53)">USS<i>John Paul Jones</i></a>, while Stone is a <a href="/wiki/Commander_(United_States)" title="Commander (United States)">commander</a> and the Commanding Officer of <a href="/wiki/USS_Sampson_(DDG-102)" title="USS Sampson (DDG-102)">USS<i>Sampson</i></a>. Alex is in a relationship with Sam and is in danger of being <a href="/wiki/Military_discharge" title="Military discharge">discharged</a> from the Navy. Their ships join the <a href="/wiki/Exercise_RIMPAC#RIMPAC_2012" title="Exercise RIMPAC">2012 Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC)</a> in Hawaii.</p>
<p>During the exercises, five alien spacecraft arrive in response to the NASA signal. One of their ships (a communications ship) collides with a satellite and crashes in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, causing heavy casualties and damages while the other four (a Mothership and three warships with red, green and blue sidelights) land in the water near Hawaii. <i>Sampson</i>, <i>John Paul Jones</i>, and the <a href="/wiki/Japan_Maritime_Self-Defense_Force" title="Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force">JMSDF</a> <a href="/wiki/Kong%C5%8D-class_destroyer" title="Kong-class destroyer"><i>Kong</i>-class destroyer</a> <i><a href="/wiki/JDS_My%C5%8Dk%C5%8D" title="JDS Myk">Myk</a></i> are ordered to investigate. Upon arrival at the indicated location, they discover a massive floating structure. Alex and two crew members, Raikes and Beast, are sent to approach the structure in an armed <a href="/wiki/Zodiac_Marine_%26_Pool" title="Zodiac Marine &amp; Pool" class="mw-redirect">Zodiac</a>.</p>
<p>When Alex touches the structure, it knocks him away, and generates a massive <a href="/wiki/Force_shield" title="Force shield" class="mw-redirect">force field</a> that encloses the Hawaiian islands, all the alien warships and separates the three ships from the RIMPAC fleet. The three alien warships appear from underwater and face the three Navy ships in a defensive posture. <i>Sampson</i> issues a blast from its fog horn, but the alien warships answer it with a damaging sonic blast, shattering all the glass on the ship's bridge. After a warning shot from <i>John Paul Jones</i>, the alien warship monitors reevaluates the Earth ships' <a href="/wiki/Identification_friend_or_foe" title="Identification friend or foe">friend or foe</a> status, changing the color for the Navy ships from green to red and respond with shots of their own. In the ensuing engagement, both the <i>Sampson</i> and the <i>Myk</i> are sunk, and the <i>John Paul Jones</i> is damaged with both Commanding and Executive Officers killed.</p>
<p>Alex sees his brother die in the explosion in <i>Sampson</i> and returns to his ship. Being the most senior officer left on the ship, he is forced to take command, to the disbelief of the crew. Alex orders an attack, but Beast manages to calm him down. They recover the survivors from <i>Myk</i>, including Captain Nagata with whom Alex is in a rivalry. The alien warships remain in a defensive posture but do not engage the <i>John Paul Jones</i> in a battle. The Mothership launches three shredder-drones towards Hawaii. These drones attack and destroy military and civilian infrastructure installations on the island of <a href="/wiki/Oahu" title="Oahu">Oahu</a>, killing some civilians along the way.</p>
<p>In Oahu, Sam, a <a href="/wiki/Physical_therapist" title="Physical therapist" class="mw-redirect">physical therapist</a>, is accompanying retired <a href="/wiki/U.S._Army" title="U.S. Army" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Army</a> veteran and double amputee Mick Canales, on a mountain hike to help him adapt to his prosthetic legs. Sam and Mick run into some police officers who order them to off the mountain. The officers head up the mountain, but they are ambushed and killed by aliens. Later, Sam and Mick run into scientist Cal Zapata, who works at the communications array and informs them that the aliens had killed his grad student and took over the communications array, and then they realize that the aliens are modifying it to reestablish communications with their home planet.</p>
<p>On the <i>John Paul Jones</i>, naval personnel capture an unconscious alien from the communications ship. The alien awakens, attacks Alex and forms a brief telepathic link with him. He learns how the aliens have successfully attacked and conquered other planets. Other aliens arrive to rescue their captured comrade. One alien stays onboard, and Alex kills it by tricking it into the firing line of a <a href="/wiki/5%22/54_caliber_Mark_45_gun" title='5"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun'>5"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun</a>. Investigating the captured alien's helmet, Ordy is able to determine that the aliens are sensitive to sunlight.</p>
<p>Ashore, Zapata steals a spectrum analyzer from the aliens, and though he is caught by an alien, successfully escapes. Using it, Sam and Mick to contact the <i>John Paul Jones</i> crews and inform them that in four hours, the aliens will be able to contact their planet.</p>
<p>The <i>John Paul Jones</i> prepare to retaliate. As the force field has disabled their radar functions, Nagata suggests using <a href="/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration">NOAA</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Tsunami_warning_system" title="Tsunami warning system">tsunami warning buoys</a> around Hawaii to track the alien warships. Using this strategy, the <i>John Paul Jones</i> destroys and sinks two of the three alien warships. At dawn, they manage to make the third warship face East, where Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows. Blinded by sunlight, the warship's crew is disorganized. Seizing the chance, the <i>John Paul Jones</i> successfully destroy it, but the Mothership retaliates with shredder-drones. The crew abandons the <i>John Paul Jones</i>, which is rapidly destroyed by shredder-drones and sunk.</p>
<p>Alex, along with the survivors of the <i>John Paul Jones</i> and <i>Myk</i> return to Pearl Harbor and commandeer the <a href="/wiki/USS_Missouri_(BB-63)" title="USS Missouri (BB-63)">USS<i>Missouri</i></a>, a decommissioned <a href="/wiki/Battleship" title="Battleship">battleship</a> turned into a <a href="/wiki/Museum_ship" title="Museum ship">museum ship</a>. They reactivate the battleship with the aid of the retired veterans preserving her, and confront the massive floating structure, which is revealed to be part of the submerged Mothership. In the ensuing battle, the <i>Missouri'</i>s <a href="/wiki/16%22/50_caliber_Mark_7_gun" title='16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun'>16-inch main guns</a> severely damage the Mothership, disabling the force field in the process. Meanwhile, Mick, Sam and Zapata distract the aliens near the communications array to buy the <i>Missouri</i> more time. The Mothership reactivates and prepares to launch shredder-drones against the <i>Missouri</i>. Instead of shooting the Mothership, Alex uses the last shell to destroy the communications array on the island, cutting the aliens' contact with their home planet. Before the <i>Missouri</i> is destroyed by the shredder-drones, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australian</a> <a href="/wiki/F/A-18" title="F/A-18" class="mw-redirect">F/A-18</a> fighters from the RIMPAC fleet arrive, destroying the shredder-drones and the Mothership, eliminating the alien threat.</p>
<p>A ceremony is held to honor the Navy personnel, where Alex is promoted to <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_commander_(United_States)" title="Lieutenant commander (United States)">lieutenant commander</a>. He is presented with a <a href="/wiki/Silver_Star" title="Silver Star">Silver Star</a> and his brother's posthumous <a href="/wiki/Navy_Cross_(United_States)" title="Navy Cross (United States)" class="mw-redirect">Navy Cross</a>. After the ceremony, Alex is given an offer to become a <a href="/wiki/Navy_SEAL" title="Navy SEAL" class="mw-redirect">Navy SEAL</a>, and then asks Admiral Shane for his daughter's hand in marriage. The Admiral initially refuses but invites Alex to lunch to discuss the matter, referencing how Alex and Sam met.</p>

Director Peter Berg stated:</p>
<p>"Working with composers often is a really frustrating experience because you speak a different language and, oftentimes, they take two or three jobs, at the same time. They're difficult and pretentious and they're tormented artists. I'm not going to name names, but most of them are. One guy who isn't is <a href="/wiki/Hans_Zimmer" title="Hans Zimmer">Hans Zimmer</a>, who taught Steve Jablonsky. We had a couple of meetings and I came up with this idea. The day I met with him, I had had an <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging" title="Magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</a> for my neck, and they make that really scary sound. I was like, "I just had this MRI, and when I was in there, I was thinking about the aliens, and it was really scary." And he was like, "Oh, that's awesome!" He went and recorded MRIs and made music out of MRIs, and that's the theme of the aliens in our film. He is no drama, and just goes and gets it done. The score is big and awesome and scary and driving. At times, it's very simple and acoustic and touching and emotional. He's the best I've ever worked with."<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Unemployed amateur musician Xia Luo (, Shen Teng) attends the wedding of Qiu Ya (, Wang Zhi), his high school crush. He overdrinks, makes an inebriated declaration of love to Qiu Ya, and angers his wife Ma Dongmei (, Ma Li), who publicly shames him for being a poor provider and husband.</p>
<p>After causing chaos as his wife pursues him through the wedding hall, Xia Luo locks himself into a bathroom at the wedding venue, flies into a rage of self-hatred and passes out, waking up in his teenage body in his middle-school classroom in 1997. After impulsively beating up his teacher, setting fire to the classroom, and kissing Qiu Ya, he jumps out a window to end the dream, but after waking up in hospital still in 1997, is forced to make the best of things.</p>
<p>Although Xia Luo appears his normal teenage self to everyone else in 1997, he retains all his memories of adult life, including around twenty years of as yet unwritten pop music - which he decides to present as his own work, to gain fame and to win the heart of Qiu Ya. Over the next twenty years he becomes a pop megastar in China, taking the place of other superstar singers from the original 1990s to 2000s timeline, including 'ghostwriting' famous TV themes for pop radio and duetting with <a href="/wiki/Sarah_Brightman" title="Sarah Brightman">Sarah Brightman</a> at the <a href="/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics" title="2008 Summer Olympics">2008 Beijing Olympic</a> opening ceremony in place of <a href="/wiki/Liu_Huan" title="Liu Huan">Liu Huan</a>.</p>
<p>Having achieved all of his ambitions including marrying Qiu Ya, Xia Luo gradually realizes that he was destined to be with Ma Dongmei - after he abandoned her in middle school in the new timeline, she nevertheless defended him from bullies and troublemakers and was forced into a simple life in a small apartment, marrying one of Xia Luo's kindly but slow-witted classmates from 1997.</p>
<p>Xia Luo makes a proposal to Ma Dongmei's husband to trade away all he owns in exchange for his wife, but the frustrated husband punches him into unconsciousness and he wakes up in a hospital bed, where it is discovered he is dying from AIDS. Ma Dongmei sings a final purloined song to him in his hospital bed, revealing that it was always her favourite (even though he was serenading Qiu Ya with it in the classroom at the time).</p>
<p>At the moment of his death, Xia Luo is thrown back into the original timeline in the wedding venue bathroom where he realizes that Ma Dongmei is the true love of his life. He runs back into the room and embraces her, which he continues to do as they are both arrested and taken to the local police station. He resumes his normal life much as before but with a new devotion to Ma Dongmei.</p>
<p>The film contains many references to Chinese popular culture in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including cameo appearances and depictions of well-known pop stars of that era. Some celebrities appear as themselves (including <a href="/wiki/Jay_Chou" title="Jay Chou">Jay Chou</a> as a talent show contestant who performed a song Xia Luo had allegedly written, in reality one that Xia Luo had plagiarized from him), whilst others are depicted through stand-ins (for instance, <a href="/wiki/Na_Ying" title="Na Ying">Miss Na</a>, who talent-spots Xia Luo in the new 1997 timeline).</p>

<p>Hanna Heller (<a href="/wiki/Saoirse_Ronan" title="Saoirse Ronan">Saoirse Ronan</a>) is a 15-year-old girl<sup id="cite_ref-Goundry20110512_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Goundry20110512-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> who lives with her father, Erik Heller (<a href="/wiki/Eric_Bana" title="Eric Bana">Eric Bana</a>) in rural northern <a href="/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Kuusamo" title="Kuusamo">Kuusamo</a>. The film opens with her <a href="/wiki/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a> and killing a <a href="/wiki/Reindeer" title="Reindeer">reindeer</a>, first by shooting it with an <a href="/wiki/Arrow" title="Arrow">arrow</a> that just misses its <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a>, and then killing it with a <a href="/wiki/Handgun" title="Handgun">handgun</a>.</p>
<p>Since the age of two, Hanna has been trained by Erik, an ex-<a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> operative from <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, to be a skilled <a href="/wiki/Assassin" title="Assassin" class="mw-redirect">assassin</a>. He teaches her hand-to-hand combat and drills her in target shooting. He left the agency, going incognito into the Arctic. Erik knows a secret that cannot become public, and is being sought by Marissa Wiegler (<a href="/wiki/Cate_Blanchett" title="Cate Blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a>), a senior CIA officer, who wants to eliminate him. Erik has trained Hanna with the intent that she will kill Marissa. Hanna reads a bloodstained <a href="/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales" title="Grimms' Fairy Tales">Grimms' Fairy Tales</a> book frequently, has a great deal of encyclopedic knowledge, and is fluent in several languages. Due to her training away from civilization, she has never come into contact with modern <a href="/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a> or <a href="/wiki/Culture" title="Culture">culture</a>, and is unfamiliar with <a href="/wiki/Music" title="Music">music</a> or <a href="/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a>. She has memorized a series of fake <a href="/wiki/Back-story" title="Back-story" class="mw-redirect">back-stories</a> for herself to be used "when the time comes".</p>
<p>One night, Hanna tells Erik that she is "ready" to face their enemies. Erik digs up a <a href="/wiki/Distress_radio_beacon" title="Distress radio beacon" class="mw-redirect">radio beacon</a> that will alert the outside world to their presence. Warning Hanna that if Marissa ever finds her, she "won't stop until you're dead. Or she is", he reluctantly allows Hanna the freedom to make her decision. After some consideration, Hanna flips the switch. Erik leaves, instructing her to meet him in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. Hanna kills two of the special forces team when they enter the cabin and then waits for the rest, knowing that they will assume her father to have killed the pair before escaping.</p>
<p>Hanna is taken to an underground CIA complex. Marissa is suspicious of Hanna's request to talk to her, and sends in a body double (<a href="/wiki/Michelle_Dockery" title="Michelle Dockery">Michelle Dockery</a>) instead. Hanna asks the body double where she met her father. The double, who is being fed answers through an <a href="/wiki/Earpiece" title="Earpiece" class="mw-redirect">earpiece</a> by Marissa, answers the questions correctly, and Hanna starts to cry and crawls sobbing into the lap of the double, which makes the officials uneasy. They send soldiers and a doctor to her cell to sedate her. As they enter the cell, Hanna kills the double, and several others (stealing a handgun from one), breaks free through the <a href="/wiki/HVAC" title="HVAC">ventilation</a> system and escapes.</p>
<p>In a flashback, Marissa is seen firing at a car that is carrying Johanna Zadek, Hanna's mother; two-year-old Hanna; and Erik. The car crashes but the trio flee. Marissa follows, shooting Johanna as she lies on the ground. But Erik escapes with Hanna into the woods.</p>
<p>Hanna finds herself on the run in the <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Moroccan</a><sup id="cite_ref-Goundry20110512_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Goundry20110512-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> desert, where she meets Sebastian (<a href="/wiki/Jason_Flemyng" title="Jason Flemyng">Jason Flemyng</a>) and Rachel (<a href="/wiki/Olivia_Williams" title="Olivia Williams">Olivia Williams</a>), a bohemian <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> couple on a camper-van holiday with their teenage daughter, Sophie (<a href="/wiki/Jessica_Barden" title="Jessica Barden">Jessica Barden</a>), and their younger son, Miles (Aldo Maland). She sneaks into the family's camper-van and hitches a ferry ride to <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> with the goal of reaching <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>. The family is nice to her, and she and Sophie become friends, and spend some time together, even sharing a kiss.</p>
<p>Marissa hires Isaacs (<a href="/wiki/Tom_Hollander" title="Tom Hollander">Tom Hollander</a>), a former agent, to capture Hanna. Hanna travels with the family as they drive north. Isaacs and two <a href="/wiki/Skinhead" title="Skinhead">skinheads</a> trail them and eventually corner Hanna and the family in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, but she manages to escape, killing one of the men. Marissa arrives and interrogates the British family, finding out that Hanna is heading to Berlin, her place of birth.</p>
<p>Arriving at the address her father had told her, Hanna meets with Knepfler (<a href="/wiki/Martin_Wuttke" title="Martin Wuttke">Martin Wuttke</a>), an eccentric old magician and a friend of Erik's, who lives in a <a href="/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales" title="Grimms' Fairy Tales">Grimms' Fairy Tales</a>-themed house in an abandoned <a href="/wiki/Amusement_park" title="Amusement park">amusement park</a>. It is Hanna's 16th birthday and Knepfler makes her <a href="/wiki/Breakfast" title="Breakfast">breakfast</a>. Hanna plans a rendezvous with her father. However, Marissa and Isaacs arrive. Hanna escapes, but not before she overhears comments that suggest Erik is not her biological father.</p>
<p>Later, Hanna meets her father at her German grandmother's apartment, whom Marissa had already shot in a previous scene. Hanna demands he tell her the truth, and he admits that he is not her biological father. Erik once recruited pregnant women into a program where their children's <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> was enhanced in order to create <a href="/wiki/Super-soldier" title="Super-soldier" class="mw-redirect">super-soldiers</a>. The project was shut down, with almost all of its subjects eliminated.</p>
<p>Marissa and Isaacs arrive, intent on killing them; Erik acts as a distraction to allow Hanna to escape. Erik kills Isaacs in a brutal fight, but is shot by Marissa, who returns to the Grimm house. Hanna is there, having just discovered Knepfler dead. After a chase, Hanna and Marissa confront one another. Hanna pleads for the killing to end, saying she does not want to hurt anyone else. Marissa says she just wants to talk, but when Hanna starts walking away, she shoots her. Hanna responds by shooting her with an arrow she had pulled from Knepfler's body. Hanna falls to the ground, but gets up, regains her bearings and follows Marissa into a tunnel. She sees a deer, then spots Marissa fleeing up a water slide. The unarmed Hanna chases Marissa to the top of the slide's stairs, as Marissa shoots at her. Near the top, it becomes clear that Hanna's arrow did serious damage, and just as she is about to shoot Hanna, a disoriented Marissa falls and slides down the water flume, dropping her handgun. Hanna follows, picks up the dropped gun, and shoots her in the heart. This <a href="/wiki/Framing_device" title="Framing device" class="mw-redirect">bookend scene</a> mirrors the opening of the film in which Hanna hunts and kills the reindeer.</p>

<p>Following a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust" title="Nuclear holocaust">nuclear holocaust</a>, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. <a href="/wiki/Max_Rockatansky" title="Max Rockatansky">Max Rockatansky</a>, a survivor, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a <a href="/wiki/Universal_blood_donor" title="Universal blood donor" class="mw-redirect">universal blood donor</a>, Max is imprisoned and used as a "blood bag" for a sick War Boy called Nux. Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Imperator_Furiosa" title="Imperator Furiosa">Imperator Furiosa</a>, one of Joe's lieutenants, is sent in her armored semi-truck, the "War Rig", to collect gasoline. When she drives off-route, Joe realises that his five wiveswomen selected for breedingare missing. Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.</p>
<p>Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. A battle ensues between the War Rig and Joe's forces. Furiosa drives into a <a href="/wiki/Sand_storm" title="Sand storm" class="mw-redirect">sand storm</a>, evading her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed. After the storm, Max sees Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by the Wives: Capable, Cheedo, Toast, the Dag and Angharad, who is heavily pregnant with Joe's child. Max steals the Rig, but its <a href="/wiki/Kill_switch" title="Kill switch">kill switch</a> disables it. Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the Wives accompany him; Nux, left behind, is picked up by Joe's army.</p>
<p>Furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled <a href="/wiki/Canyon" title="Canyon">canyon</a> to barter a deal for safe passage; however, with Joe's forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, forcing her and the group to flee while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe. Max and Furiosa fight pursuing bikers as Joe's car, with Nux now on board, surmounts the blockade and eventually attacks the War Rig, allowing Nux to board. However, as the Rig escapes, Angharad falls off in an attempt to protect Max and is run over by Joe's car, killing her and her child.</p>
<p>Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the "Green Place," an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig, distraught over his failure, and consoles him. That night, the Rig gets stuck in mud. Furiosa and Max slow Joe's forces with mines, but Joe's ally, the Bullet Farmer, continues pursuing them. Nux helps Max free the Rig while Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer. Max walks into the dark to confront the Bullet Farmer and his men, returning with guns and ammunition.</p>
<p>They drive the War Rig overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. Max suspects a trap, but Furiosa approaches the woman and states her history and clan affiliation. The naked woman summons her clan, the Vuvalini, who recognise Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the Green Place, now uninhabitable. The group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense <a href="/wiki/Salt_pan_(geology)" title="Salt pan (geology)">salt flats</a> in the hope of finding a new home. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army in the bikers' canyon.</p>
<p>The group heads back to the Citadel, but they are attacked en route by Joe's forces, and Furiosa is seriously wounded. Joe positions his car in front of the War Rig to slow it, while Max fights Joe's giant son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures Toast, but she distracts him long enough for Furiosa to rip off his breathing mask, killing him. Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini to successfully escape in Joe's car, where Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa to help her survive her injuries.</p>
<p>At the Citadel, the impoverished citizens are overjoyed at the sight of Joe's corpse. Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the remaining War Boys, but Max walks away, sharing a glance with Furiosa before disappearing into the crowd.</p>

<p>In 1984 <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stasi" title="Stasi">Stasi</a> Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (<a href="/wiki/Ulrich_M%C3%BChe" title="Ulrich Mhe">Ulrich Mhe</a>), code name HGW XX/7, suggests to his superiors that he begin to spy on the playwright Georg Dreyman (<a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Koch" title="Sebastian Koch">Sebastian Koch</a>). Wiesler and his team bug the apartment, set up surveillance equipment in an attic, and begin reporting Dreyman's activities. Dreyman, who escaped state scrutiny due to his pro-Communist views and international recognition, soon learns the real reason behind the surveillance: Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf (<a href="/wiki/Thomas_Thieme" title="Thomas Thieme">Thomas Thieme</a>) covets Dreyman's girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland (<a href="/wiki/Martina_Gedeck" title="Martina Gedeck">Martina Gedeck</a>), and is trying to eliminate Dreyman as a romantic rival. While Wiesler's superior, Lt. Col. Anton Grubitz (<a href="/wiki/Ulrich_Tukur" title="Ulrich Tukur">Ulrich Tukur</a>), sees an opportunity for advancement, the idealist Wiesler asks Grubitz, "Is this why we joined?" Minister Hempf coerces Sieland into having sex with him by exploiting her vulnerability as an insecure actress. After discovering Sieland's relationship with Hempf, Dreyman implores her not to meet him again. Sieland flees to a nearby bar where Wiesler, posing as a fan, urges her to be true to herself. She returns home and reconciles with Dreyman, rejecting Hempf.</p>
<p>Though a communist and supporter of the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_of_the_GDR" title="Council of Ministers of the GDR">regime</a>, Dreyman becomes disillusioned with the treatment of his colleagues by the state. At his birthday party, his friend Albert Jerska (a <a href="/wiki/Blacklist_(employment)" title="Blacklist (employment)">blacklisted</a> theatrical director) gives him <a href="/wiki/Sheet_music" title="Sheet music">sheet music</a> for <i>Sonate vom Guten Menschen</i> (<i>Sonata for a Good Man</i>). Shortly afterwards, Jerska hangs himself. Dreyman decides to publish an anonymous article on the East German suicide rate in <i><a href="/wiki/Der_Spiegel" title="Der Spiegel">Der Spiegel</a></i>, a prominent West German newsweekly. Dreyman's article accuses the state of callously ignoring those who commit suicide. Since all East German <a href="/wiki/Typewriter" title="Typewriter">typewriters</a> are registered, an editor of <i>Der Spiegel</i> smuggles Dreyman a miniature typewriter with a red ribbon. Dreyman hides the typewriter in the floor of his apartment, but is seen one afternoon by Sieland hiding it there as she returns to the apartment. Meanwhile, a disillusioned Wiesler has a change of heart about his own role in protecting the regime.</p>
<p>When Dreyman and his friends check whether his flat is bugged, Wiesler, who has become sympathetic to Dreyman, does not alert the border guards, and the conspirators believe they are safe. After learning that it was Dreyman who actually wrote the article, Wiesler races to Colonel Grubitz's office intending to notify his boss of the breakthrough; but as soon as he hears Grubitz talk about how to silence dissident artists like Dreyman, Wiesler changes his mind and asks for the surveillance to be scaled back.</p>
<p>A few days later, Dreyman's article is published, angering the East German authorities. The Stasi obtains a copy of the suicide article, typewritten in red ink, but they are unable to link it to any typewriter legally registered in the GDR. Livid at being jilted by Sieland and her abuse of prescription medication, Hempf orders Grubitz to arrest her. She is blackmailed into revealing Dreyman's authorship of the article and becoming an informant. When the Stasi search his apartment, however, they cannot find the typewriter. Dreyman and his friends conclude that Sieland could not have informed because she would have given away the location of the hidden typewriter. Grubitz, suspicious that Wiesler has mentioned nothing unusual in his daily reports of the monitoring, gives Wiesler "one more chance" and orders him to do the follow-up interrogation of Sieland. Wiesler resumes his role as Stasi interrogator and forces Sieland to tell him exactly where the typewriter is hidden.</p>
<p>Grubitz and the Stasi return to Dreyman's apartment. Sieland panics when she realizes that Dreyman will know she betrayed him and flees the apartment. When Grubitz removes the floor, however, the typewriter is goneWiesler having removed the hidden evidence. Unaware that the typewriter was removed, Sieland runs to the street and commits suicide by stepping into the path of an oncoming truck. Grubitz offers a perfunctory claim of sympathy and informs Dreyman that the investigation is over. Wiesler drives Grubitz back to the Stasi and is told that his career is over, and that his remaining 20 years with the agency will be in Department M, a dead-end position for disgraced agents. As he leaves, Grubitz discards a newspaper announcing <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> as the new leader of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.</p>
<p>On November 9, 1989, Wiesler is steaming open letters in the cramped, windowless office of Department M when a co-worker tells him about the <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall" title="Fall of the Berlin Wall" class="mw-redirect">fall of the Berlin Wall</a>. Realizing that this will mean the end of the GDR and the Stasi, Wiesler silently stands and leaves the office, inspiring his co-workers to do the same. Two years later, Hempf and Dreyman have a chance encounter while both are attending a new performance of Dreyman's play. Dreyman asks the former government minister why he had never been monitored. Much to his surprise, Hempf tells him that he had, in fact, been under full surveillance and to "look behind the light switches" for the listening devices that had been installed in 1984.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Stasi_Records_Agency" title="Stasi Records Agency">Stasi Records Agency</a>, Dreyman reviews the files the Stasi kept while he was under surveillance. He reads that Sieland was released just before the second search, and could not have removed the typewriter. As he goes through his files, he is at first confused by the false and contradicting information that has been written about his activities, but when he reaches the final typewritten report, he sees a fingerprint in red ink just under the signature. Dreyman finally realizes that it was the writerStasi agent HGWXX/7who had knowingly concealed his illegal activities, including his authorship of the suicide article, and that he had been the one who had removed the typewriter from its hidden location. Dreyman searches for Wiesler, who has a job as a postman, and finds him on his rounds. Unsure of what to say to him, however, he decides not to approach him.</p>
<p>Two years later, Wiesler still has the same job and, whilst on his round, passes a bookstore window display promoting Dreyman's new novel, <i>Sonate vom Guten Menschen</i>. He goes inside and opens a copy of the book, discovering it is dedicated "To HGW XX/7, with gratitude". Deeply moved, Wiesler buys the book. When the sales clerk asks if he wants it gift-wrapped, he responds, "No. It's for me."</p>

<p>He said the idea for the film came to him when he was trying to come up with a scenario for a film class. He was listening to music and recalled <a href="/wiki/Maxim_Gorky" title="Maxim Gorky">Maxim Gorky</a>'s saying that <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Lenin</a>'s favorite piece of music was <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._23_(Beethoven)" title="Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)">Appassionata</a></i>. Gorky recounted a discussion with Lenin:</p>
<p>And screwing up his eyes and chuckling, [Lenin] added without mirth:</p>
<p>But I can't listen to music often, it affects my nerves, it makes me want to say sweet nothings and pat the heads of people who, living in a filthy hell, can create such beauty. But today we mustn't pat anyone on the head or we'll get our hand bitten off; we've got to hit them on the heads, hit them without mercy, though in the ideal we are against doing any violence to people. Hm-hmit's a hellishly difficult office!</p>
<p>Donnersmarck told a <i>New York Times</i> reporter: "I suddenly had this image in my mind of a person sitting in a depressing room with earphones on his head and listening in to what he supposes is the enemy of the state and the enemy of his ideas, and what he is really hearing is beautiful music that touches him.

<p></p>
<p>A girl named Riley Andersen is born in <a href="/wiki/Minnesota" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and within her mind, five personifications of her <a href="/wiki/Emotion#Basic_emotions" title="Emotion">basic emotions</a> - Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger - gradually come to life. As Riley grows up, her emotions influence her actions via a control console in her mind's Headquarters. Her memories are stored in colored orbs, which are sent into <a href="/wiki/Long-term_memory" title="Long-term memory">long-term memory</a> each night via a suction tube. The most important "core memories" are housed in a hub and power five "islands", each reflecting a different aspect of her personality. Joy's purpose is to keep Riley happy, Fear protects her from danger, Disgust guards her health and social status, and Anger ensures that she is treated fairly. Since no one understands Sadness's purpose (even Sadness herself), Joy tries to steer her away from the console.</p>
<p>When Riley is 11 years old, she and her parents move to <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. She is disappointed by their new home and other difficulties: the moving van with all their belongings gets lost, and her father is under stress due to his struggling business. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by keeping her isolated. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes her to cry in front of her class, creating a sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it before it reaches the hub, but instead knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, depowering the personality islands and rendering them unstable. Joy and Sadness are sucked into the memory tube and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory, taking the core memories with them.</p>
<p>With Joy and Sadness gone, Anger, Fear, and Disgust try to maintain Riley's emotional state, but only end up unintentionally distancing her from her parents, friends and hobbies, making her personality islands gradually crumble and fall, one by one, into the "Memory Dump", an abyss where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to <a href="/wiki/Runaway_(dependent)" title="Runaway (dependent)">run away</a>, believing the only way she can be happy again is to go back to Minnesota.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood <a href="/wiki/Imaginary_friend" title="Imaginary friend">imaginary friend</a>. He tells them they can get to Headquarters by riding the <a href="/wiki/Train_of_thought" title="Train of thought">train of thought</a>. After chasing the train through Riley's mind, the three eventually catch the train, but it is derailed when one of the personality islands collapses when Riley steals a credit card from her mother's purse, leaving Joy and Sadness distraught.</p>
<p>In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and attempts to ride a "<a href="/wiki/Recall_(memory)" title="Recall (memory)">recall tube</a>" back to Headquarters, but a piece of a personality island collapses, breaking the tube and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump. While despairingly looking through fading memories, Joy discovers a sad memory of a hockey game that becomes happy when Riley's parents and friends comfort her, causing her to finally realize Sadness' purpose: to alert others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help.</p>
<p>Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump, but after several tries, Bing Bong realizes their combined weight is too much and jumps out on the third attempt, sacrificing himself and fading away to enable Joy to escape. Joy then uses various tools from around Riley's mind to propel herself and a despondent and unwilling Sadness through the air to Headquarters, to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley <a href="/wiki/Depression_(mood)" title="Depression (mood)">depressed</a> and <a href="/wiki/Apathy" title="Apathy">apathetic</a>. To the surprise of the others, Sadness (at Joy's insistence) takes control and extracts the idea, reactivating the console and prompting Riley to return home.</p>
<p>As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home and bursts into tears, confessing to her parents that she misses her old life. As her parents reassure and comfort her, Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory that combines their emotions, which restores one of the collapsed personality islands in a new and better form. One year later, Riley has fully adapted to her new home, made new friends, returned to her old hobbies, and adopted a few new ones (fueled by new, more nuanced core memories). On the inside, her emotions take their place at a new, larger console that allows them to work together, enabling Riley, now 12 years old, to lead a more emotionally complex life.</p>
<p>Several of the film's creators also contributed some voice acting, including director <a href="/wiki/Pete_Docter" title="Pete Docter">Pete Docter</a> as Father's Anger,<sup id="cite_ref-SKCastCameos_16-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SKCastCameos-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> and co-director <a href="/wiki/Ronnie_del_Carmen" title="Ronnie del Carmen">Ronnie del Carmen</a>, who provided additional voices.<sup id="cite_ref-SKCastCameos_16-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SKCastCameos-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As a child, director Pete Docter relocated with his family to <a href="/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> when his father moved to study the music of <a href="/wiki/Carl_Nielsen" title="Carl Nielsen">Carl Nielsen</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nyt-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> While his sisters had an easy time adjusting to the new surroundings, Docter felt he was judged constantly by peers.<sup id="cite_ref-iw1_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw1-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> While other kids were interested in sports, Docter sat alone drawing, a hobby that eventually led him to animation.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> His social anxiety ended by high school.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nyt-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In late 2009, Docter noticed his pre-teen daughter, Elie, exhibiting similar shyness.<sup id="cite_ref-v1_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-v1-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> "She started getting more quiet and reserved, and that, frankly, triggered a lot of my own insecurities and fears," he said.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt_19-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nyt-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> He imagined what happens in the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray "strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities."<sup id="cite_ref-npr_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-npr-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted <a href="/wiki/Paul_Ekman" title="Paul Ekman">Paul Ekman</a>, a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and <a href="/wiki/Dacher_Keltner" title="Dacher Keltner">Dacher Keltner</a>, a professor of psychology at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotionsanger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and <a href="/wiki/Surprise_(emotion)" title="Surprise (emotion)">surprise</a>. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<sup id="cite_ref-npr_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-npr-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<sup id="cite_ref-npr_23-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-npr-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<sup id="cite_ref-science_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-science-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The smash success of Docter's 2009 film <a href="/wiki/Up_(2009_film)" title="Up (2009 film)"><i>Up</i></a> encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt_19-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nyt-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Inside Out</i> is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former <a href="/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a> CEO <a href="/wiki/Steve_Jobs" title="Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>, who died in 2011. It also lacked extensive input from <a href="/wiki/John_Lasseter" title="John Lasseter">John Lasseter</a>, who was more focused on restructuring <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios" title="Walt Disney Animation Studios">Walt Disney Animation Studios</a> in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> at the time of its production.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt_19-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nyt-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making <i>Inside Out</i>, but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<sup id="cite_ref-lat_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lat-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Docter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt_19-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nyt-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's "Brain Trust", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of <i>Inside Out</i> created before it even went into production.<sup id="cite_ref-hr_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hr-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_21-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of "happy feelings".<sup id="cite_ref-vul_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-vul-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a "social storm" for Riley.<sup id="cite_ref-mf_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mf-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a <a href="/wiki/Thanksgiving_Day" title="Thanksgiving Day" class="mw-redirect">Thanksgiving Day</a> pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too "bizarre" and it was replaced.<sup id="cite_ref-sf_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sf-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Docter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of "personality islands" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into "Idea Fields", where they would "cultivate new ideas", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<sup id="cite_ref-sf_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sf-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> The character of Bing Bonga discarded old imaginary friendcame about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<sup id="cite_ref-mf_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mf-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>An early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an evaluation screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which led to fears that he might be fired. He took a long walk at his home one Sunday, in which he began to consider himself a failure, his previous successes "flukes", and a general sense that he should resign from the film.<sup id="cite_ref-npr_23-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-npr-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all. He soon reached a breakthrough: that emotions are meant to connect people together, and that relationships are the most important things in life.<sup id="cite_ref-lat_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lat-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> He decided to replace Fear with Sadness, which he felt is crucial to renewal. He met with Rivera and Del Carmen that night to explain his change of plans, and to his surprise, they reacted positively to it. At the screening, he informed his superiors that new plans for the film were in order. Although a "scary moment", the film remained in production.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt_19-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nyt-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Screenwriter <a href="/wiki/Michael_Arndt" title="Michael Arndt">Michael Arndt</a> worked for a year on the film's script, calling it "both a brilliantly creative idea but also incredibly challenging," but left the project in early 2011, adding that "knowing the Pixar process, there may not be a single word [I wrote] that remains in the final script!

"They said: 'Would you mind calling Amy? We don't want to call her and have her think we're some weirdo,'" he recalled.

<p>In envisaging how the mind's interior would be depicted, the filmmakers concentrated on the word <i>electrochemical</i>; <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston" title="Ralph Eggleston">Ralph Eggleston</a>, the film's production designer, explained, "It meant thinking of things as energy or energy-based, excitable."<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> Each emotion has a glowing, "effervescent quality" to them (particularly Joy), which was difficult to animate as it could be viewed as distracting.<sup id="cite_ref-BI_37-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BI-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> "The characters are created with this energy because we are trying to represent what emotions would look like.

<p>Don "Wardaddy" Collier, a battle-hardened <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">U.S. Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Staff_sergeant#U.S._Army" title="Staff sergeant">staff sergeant</a> in the <a href="/wiki/2nd_Armored_Division_(United_States)" title="2nd Armored Division (United States)">2nd Armored Division</a>, commands an <a href="/wiki/M4_Sherman" title="M4 Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> "Easy Eight" tank named <i>Fury</i> and its five-man, all-veteran crew: gunner Boyd "Bible" Swan; loader Grady "Coon-Ass" Travis; and driver Trini "Gordo" Garcia (all who have been together since the <a href="/wiki/North_African_Campaign" title="North African Campaign">North African Campaign</a>), as the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allies</a> make their final push into <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. When the tank's original assistant driver/bow gunner, "Red", is <a href="/wiki/Killed_in_action" title="Killed in action">killed in action</a>, Norman Ellison, a fresh recruit trained only as a <a href="/wiki/Clerk" title="Clerk">clerk typist</a>, is assigned as a reluctant replacement.</p>
<p>As the Fury and its tank platoon moves deeper into Germany, Norman's inexperience becomes dangerous: first when he fails to shoot several <a href="/wiki/Hitler_Youth" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a> scouts  who ambush the commanding officer's tank with a <a href="/wiki/Panzerfaust" title="Panzerfaust">Panzerfaust</a>, killing him and his crew; then later during a battle with German anti-tank guns, where he hesitates under fire. Wardaddy is angered at his incompetence, and after the latter incident, he orders Norman to execute a captive German soldier. When Norman refuses, Wardaddy wrestles a pistol into his hand and forces him to pull the trigger, killing the prisoner and traumatizing Norman. Wardaddy then leads the tanks to capture a small German town, where Norman earns his first confirmed kills. While searching an apartment, Wardaddy and Norman encounter a German woman, Irma, and her younger cousin, Emma. Norman and Emma go into the bedroom together, and fall in love. The four then have breakfast, but the rest of Fury's crew barges in, harassing the women and angering Wardaddy and Norman. The men soon leave, and then a German artillery bombardment strikes the town; Norman finds Emma among the dead, traumatizing him once more.</p>
<p>Wardaddy and his platoon are then ordered to hold some vital <a href="/wiki/Crossroads_(junction)" title="Crossroads (junction)" class="mw-redirect">crossroads</a> to prevent the enemy from attacking the Allies' vulnerable rear lines. They head to their objective, only to be ambushed by a German <a href="/wiki/Tiger_I" title="Tiger I">Tiger I</a>. Wardaddy leads the Shermans in a counter-attack; their shells fail to penetrate the Tiger's thick frontal armor, and its heavier cannon obliterates most of the platoon. The Fury eventually destroys the Tiger by outmaneuvering it and firing into its thinner rear armor, but with the radio damaged the Fury is forced to continue the mission alone. Just as it reaches the crossroads, the tank is immobilized by a <a href="/wiki/Landmine" title="Landmine" class="mw-redirect">landmine</a>. Norman is ordered to scout a nearby hill and he spots a battalion of <a href="/wiki/Waffen-SS" title="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a> heading their way. The crew initially wants to abandon the tank and escape on foot, but Wardaddy refuses to leave, obligating the men to stay and fight.</p>
<p>The crew disguises the Fury so that it would appear knocked-out, and then waits for the approaching Germans inside. Wardaddy breaks out a bottle of whiskey and shares it with the others, and Norman is finally accepted by the crew and given his nickname: "Machine". When the Germans arrive, the Fury reactivates and ambushes them: outnumbered and surrounded, Wardaddy and his men nevertheless inflict heavy losses on the Germans using both the tank's and their own personal weapons. As ammunition runs out and the battle turns desperate, Grady is killed by a Panzerfaust round penetrating the turret; Gordo is wounded and then sacrifices himself by covering one of his dropped grenades; then a sniper kills Bible and badly wounds Wardaddy. Wardaddy and Norman take refuge inside the tank and share their last words. Wardaddy then orders Norman to escape through an emergency hatch in the floor as the Germans drop grenades into the Fury; Norman slips out just as they explode, killing Wardaddy. Norman tries to hide as the Germans move on, but is quickly discovered by a young SS trooper; the trooper hesitates and then leaves, deciding not to report him.</p>
<p>The next morning, Norman awakens and crawls back into the tank; he covers Wardaddy's corpse with his coat and takes his revolver as he hears movement outside. Norman awaits his fate, only to discover he is being rescued by U.S. soldiers, who tell him that he's a hero. As Norman is transported to safety, he looks back at the carnage behind him: countless dead Germans, surrounding the battered and broken Fury.</p>

<p><b>Today</b><br>
The film begins with commentary by passenger Detective Graham Waters (<a href="/wiki/Don_Cheadle" title="Don Cheadle">Don Cheadle</a>) having suffered a car accident with his partner Ria (<a href="/wiki/Jennifer_Esposito" title="Jennifer Esposito">Jennifer Esposito</a>). He mentions that the denizens of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> have lost their "sense of touch." Ria and the driver of the other car, Kim Lee, exchange racially charged insults. When Waters exits the car, he arrives at a <a href="/wiki/Police" title="Police">police</a> investigation <a href="/wiki/Crime_scene" title="Crime scene">crime scene</a> concerning the discovery of "a dead kid."</p>
<p><b>Yesterday</b><br>
While purchasing a revolver at a gun store, Farhad (<a href="/wiki/Shaun_Toub" title="Shaun Toub">Shaun Toub</a>), a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri (<a href="/wiki/Bahar_Soomekh" title="Bahar Soomekh">Bahar Soomekh</a>), argue in <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title="Persian language">Persian</a> over what box of bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as "<a href="/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama</a>". Farhad clarifies that he is an American citizen but the store owner continues exchanging racially stereotypical insults at Farhad and has the security guard escort him out the store. Dorri demands the store owner to give her the gun or give her back the money. After the store owner gives the gun to Dorri, she asks for "the ones in the red box". The store owner asks why, but Dorri does not answer and insists on buying that particular box. In another part of town, two black men, Anthony (<a href="/wiki/Ludacris" title="Ludacris">Ludacris</a>) and Peter (<a href="/wiki/Larenz_Tate" title="Larenz Tate">Larenz Tate</a>), argue over racial stereotyping of African Americans after Jean Cabot (<a href="/wiki/Sandra_Bullock" title="Sandra Bullock">Sandra Bullock</a>), the wife of the local <a href="/wiki/District_attorney" title="District attorney">district attorney</a> Rick Cabot (<a href="/wiki/Brendan_Fraser" title="Brendan Fraser">Brendan Fraser</a>), walks in another direction whilst fearfully staring at them.</p>
<p>Anthony and Peter carjack the married couple as they are about to enter their <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_Navigator" title="Lincoln Navigator">Lincoln Navigator</a>. Later, at the Cabot house, Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Pe%C3%B1a" title="Michael Pea">Michael Pea</a>) is changing their locks when Jean notices his tattoos. She loudly complains to Rick about having been carjacked and now having to endure a Hispanic man changing their locks, feeling he will give copies of the keys to "his gang banger friends". Having overheard this, Daniel leaves the keys on Jean's kitchen counter. Detectives Waters and Ria arrive at the scene of a shooting between two drivers. The surviving shooter is a white male, identified as an undercover police officer. The dead shooter, a black male, is revealed also to be an undercover police officer. There is a large amount of cash found in the black officer's trunk. This is the third time the white officer has shot and killed a black man.</p>
<p>LAPD officer John Ryan (<a href="/wiki/Matt_Dillon" title="Matt Dillon">Matt Dillon</a>) calls an <a href="/wiki/HMO" title="HMO" class="mw-redirect">HMO</a> on behalf of his father and has an argument with a representative named Shaniqua Johnson (<a href="/wiki/Loretta_Devine" title="Loretta Devine">Loretta Devine</a>). He then gets into the squad car with his partner Tom Hansen (<a href="/wiki/Ryan_Philippe" title="Ryan Philippe" class="mw-redirect">Ryan Philippe</a>) and sees a car passenger performing fellatio on the driver of a moving vehicle. They pull over the Navigator similar to the one carjacked earlier, despite discrepancies in the descriptions. They order the couple, television director Cameron Thayer (<a href="/wiki/Terrence_Howard" title="Terrence Howard">Terrence Howard</a>) and his wife Christine (<a href="/wiki/Thandie_Newton" title="Thandie Newton">Thandie Newton</a>), to exit. Cameron is cooperative, but Christine is argumentative. This annoys Ryan, who manually molests Christine under the pretense of administering a pat-down. Intimidated, Cameron says nothing. The couple is released without a citation. Once home, Christine becomes enraged that Cameron did nothing while she was being violated. Cameron insists that what he did was correct and storms out.</p>
<p>Arriving home from work long after dark, Daniel finds his young daughter, Lara (<a href="/wiki/Ashlyn_Sanchez" title="Ashlyn Sanchez">Ashlyn Sanchez</a>), hiding under her bed after hearing a gunshot outside. To comfort her, Daniel gives her an "invisible impenetrable cloak", which makes her feel safe enough to fall asleep in her bed. In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter, arguing and distracted, hit a Korean man while passing a parked white van. They argue about what to do with him, finally dumping him in front of a hospital and driving away. Due to the blood in the vehicle, they are unable to receive payment for the carjacking. The next day, at the Los Angeles Police Department station, Hansen talks to his superior, Lt. Dixon (<a href="/wiki/Keith_David" title="Keith David">Keith David</a>), about switching partners. Dixon, a black man, claims that Hansen's charge of Ryan as a racist could cost both Hansen and Dixon their jobs. Dixon suggests a transfer to a one-man car and mockingly tells Hansen that he should justify it by claiming to have uncontrollable flatulence.</p>
<p>Ryan visits Shaniqua and apologizes for the argument. He explains that his father was previously diagnosed with a bladder infection, but he fears it may be <a href="/wiki/Prostate_cancer" title="Prostate cancer">prostate cancer</a>. Shaniqua nearly calls security to escort Ryan out of her office when he proceeds to insult Shaniqua by calling her an affirmative action hire. When Ryan asks for his father to see a different doctor, Shaniqua denies the request and he storms out of her office in anger. Meanwhile, Daniel is seen replacing a lock at Farhad's shop and tries to explain to him that the door frame needs to be replaced. Farhad, whose English is limited, misunderstands and accuses Daniel of cheating him, which causes Daniel to leave.</p>
<p><b>Today</b><br>
The next morning, Farhad discovers the store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti. His insurance company does not cover the damage, calling it a case of negligence due to the defective door. When Farhad is told that his shop will be closing down, he vows revenge on Daniel. Detective Waters visits his mother (<a href="/wiki/Beverly_Todd" title="Beverly Todd">Beverly Todd</a>), a hard drug abuser. She asks him to find his missing younger brother. He promises and takes notice that there is almost no food in the apartment as he is leaving. When he tries to present evidence in the shooting between undercover police officers, his superiors tell him not to reveal the cash in the black officer's trunk, saying that their work in crafting a non-racist image for the department will be undone.</p>
<p>Jean comes home and sees dishes in the dishwasher. She accosts her Hispanic maid Maria for not putting them in the cupboards. Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. Upon recognizing Ryan, Christine becomes hysterical, but gasoline is leaking from the tank and running downhill towards another wreck, which has already caught fire. He calms her down, and with the assistance of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter approach another Navigator which happens to be Cameron's. They only see Cameron driving after they open the door and are shocked to see that the driver is black. Cameron is tired of being pushed around and resists. Anthony tells Peter to shoot Cameron, but Peter does not.</p>
<p>As police officers arrive, Cameron and Anthony both race for the car and jump in. Cameron drives away, with Anthony continuing to point a gun at him. A car chase ensues. Hansen is one of the police officers who has responded and recognizes Cameron's vehicle. Cameron drives into a dead end, puts Anthony's gun into his pocket, and gets out of the car, all the while yelling insults at the officers. Just before he pulls out the gun, Hansen convinces him to stop aggravating the situation and to go home. Hansen vouches for Cameron, fending off the other officers, and promising to give him a "harsh" warning. Later, Cameron tells Anthony that as a black man he is embarrassed for him and drops Anthony off at a bus stop.</p>
<p>Farhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush. Just as Daniel's daughter Lara jumps into his arms, attempting to protect him with the "invisible cloak", Daniel's wife Elizabeth (<a href="/wiki/Karina_Arroyave" title="Karina Arroyave">Karina Arroyave</a>) runs out the front door and watches in horror as Farhad shoots Lara. It takes the grief-stricken parents and Farhad a moment to realize that Lara is miraculously unharmed. The box of ammunition that Dorri had selected contained <a href="/wiki/Blank_(cartridge)" title="Blank (cartridge)">blanks</a>. Farhad later tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. Jean is complaining to someone she knows over the phone that she wakes up angry every day and does not know why. Immediately afterwards, she slips and falls down a flight of stairs, spraining her ankle. Jean phones Rick, telling him of her accident. Whilst resting in her bed, Jean hugs Maria, saying she is the only true friend she has ever had and apologizes.</p>
<p>Peter, who is hitchhiking, is picked up by Hansen. Peter sees that Hansen has a small statuette of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Christopher" title="Saint Christopher">Saint Christopher</a> like his own. He begins to laugh as he realizes that they have so much in common, but Hansen thinks that he is being laughed at. Hansen pulls over and tells Peter to get out if he wants to be "funny". Peter moves to pull the statuette out of his pocket in explanation, but Hansen believes he is pulling out a gun and mistakenly shoots and kills Peter. Hansen dumps the body in the bush beside a road and then torches his own car. Peter is revealed to be Waters' missing brother. Waters and his mother meet at the morgue, where Dorri is revealed to be a coroner and Waters promises to find who is responsible. Mrs. Waters blames her surviving son for his brother's death, claiming he was always too busy to look for Peter.</p>
<p>Anthony returns to the white van owned by the Korean man whom they had run over the night before. Finding the keys still hanging from the door lock, he drives the van away. The Korean man's wife Kim Lee arrives at the previously mentioned hospital looking for her husband, the man who was run over, named Choi Jin Gui. Conscious and coherent, he tells her to go and immediately cash a check that he has in his wallet. Anthony has driven the white van to a chop shop he frequents, and as they inspect the van, a number of Cambodian immigrants are discovered locked in the back of the van, revealing that Choi was involved in <a href="/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>. Anthony is offered $500 for each person in the van but refuses out of disgust. Anthony drives to <a href="/wiki/Chinatown,_Los_Angeles" title="Chinatown, Los Angeles">Chinatown</a> and sets the Cambodian people free. As Anthony drives away, he passes a car crash, which turns out to involve Shaniqua. Shaniqua and the other driver get out and begin to exchange racial slurs.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In 2013, an inter-dimensional portal, the Breach, appears at the bottom of the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. From the Breach, giant monsters called <a href="/wiki/Kaiju" title="Kaiju">Kaiju</a> periodically emerge and attack cities on the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Rim" title="Pacific Rim">Pacific Rim</a>. The <a href="/wiki/United_nations" title="United nations" class="mw-redirect">United Nations</a> fund the Jaeger Program to construct the Jaegers, giant <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">mecha</a> robots, to fight the Kaiju. Each Jaeger is controlled by two or more pilots, who are mentally linked (called "drifting") to share the mental burden of piloting the machines.</p>
<p>In 2020, pilots Raleigh and Yancy Becket are assigned to protect the Alaskan coastline from a Kaiju in their Jaeger, <i>Gipsy Danger</i>. The Kaiju survives their initial assault and blindsides <i>Gipsy Danger</i>, wrecking it and killing Yancy. Raleigh is able to single-handedly kill the Kaiju and pilot the heavily damaged <i>Gipsy Danger</i> back to shore. Traumatized by Yancy, his brother and only remaining family's death, he quits the program.</p>
<p>By 2025, the Jaeger Program is deemed inefficient by world leaders, as the increasing numbers and strength of the Kaiju are destroying them at a faster rate than they can be built. They decide to shut down the program and construct defensive coastal walls instead. <a href="/wiki/Marshal" title="Marshal">Marshal</a> Stacker Pentecost, commander of the Jaegers, plans to launch a final assault on the Breach with a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_bomb" title="Nuclear bomb" class="mw-redirect">nuclear bomb</a>, despite past attempts being unsuccessful. He tracks down Raleigh and recruits him back into the program.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> base (Shatterdome), Raleigh meets the crews for the remaining Jaegers, and Pentecosts adopted daughter Mako Mori. She shows great potential as a pilot, and Raleigh manages to convince Pentecost to let her drift with him. In their first drift in the repaired <i>Gipsy Danger</i>, Raleigh briefly falls out of synch. Mako becomes lost in her childhood memory of the Kaiju attack on <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> that orphaned her, and nearly discharges <i>Gipsy Danger's</i> plasma cannon until the Jaeger is shut down. Pentecost <a href="/wiki/Grounding" title="Grounding" class="mw-disambig">grounds</a> an ashamed Mako, leaving Raleigh without a copilot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientist Newton Geiszler creates a device that allows him to drift with a Kaiju brain fragment. He discovers that the Kaiju are <a href="/wiki/Bioweapon" title="Bioweapon" class="mw-redirect">bioweapons</a> created by extraterrestrial colonists to wipe out humanity. Pentecost sends him to find Kaiju <a href="/wiki/Black_market" title="Black market">black market</a> dealer Hannibal Chau, who operates within Hong Kong, to obtain an intact Kaiju brain and acquire more information. He soon learns that, during the drift, the Kaiju <a href="/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)" title="Group mind (science fiction)">hive mind</a> becomes aware of his consciousness. As a result, two Kaiju are unleashed upon the city.</p>
<p>The other Jaegers, <i>Crimson Typhoon</i>, <i>Cherno Alpha</i>, and <i>Striker Eureka</i>, are sent to slay the Kaiju, but the first two are destroyed while <i>Striker</i> is immobilized by an <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse_in_fiction_and_popular_culture" title="Electromagnetic pulse in fiction and popular culture">EMP blast</a>. Out of options, Pentecost allows Raleigh and Mako to pilot <i>Gipsy Danger</i>, and the two pilots successfully kill both Kaiju. Newton and Hannibal go to retrieve one of the Kaijus brain and discover it is pregnant. The infant Kaiju swallows Hannibal but is strangled by its own <a href="/wiki/Umbilical_cord" title="Umbilical cord">umbilical cord</a>. Newton and Hermann Gottlieb, another scientist, drift together with the infant Kaiju's brain. They discover that only the Kaiju can travel through the Breach and warn the Jaeger team.</p>
<p>Raleigh finds out Pentecost is terminally ill due to piloting a first generation Jaeger with no radiation shielding. The last time he piloted a Jaeger was during the Tokyo attack, during which he was forced to single-handedly kill the Kaiju, making him and Raleigh the only pilots who have killed a Kaiju without a copilot (known as solo combat). The Jaeger teams resume the original plan, with Pentecost and Chuck Hansen piloting <i>Striker Eureka</i> which carries a nuclear bomb. They, along with <i>Gipsy Danger</i>, travel to the Breach. They are confronted by three Kaiju, including the biggest one they have seen. Both Jaegers are severely damaged in the battle. Overwhelmed, Pentecost and Chuck decide to detonate the bomb and kill two of the Kaiju.</p>
<p><i>Gipsy Danger</i> kills the surviving Kaiju and rides its body through the Breach into the alien dimension. Raleigh ejects Makos escape pod and manually overloads <i>Gipsy Danger</i>s <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactor</a>. He then escapes in the remaining pod. The Jaeger explodes, destroying the aliens and sealing the Breach. Raleigh and Mako surface in the Pacific Ocean and embrace for their victory as rescue helicopters arrive.</p>
<p>In a mid-credits scene, Hannibal cuts his way out of the dead infant Kaiju.</p>
<p>Additional Jaeger pilots include Charles Luu, Lance Luu and Mark Luu as the Wei Tang triplets (China), and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Maillet" title="Robert Maillet">Robert Maillet</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heather_Doerksen" title="Heather Doerksen">Heather Doerksen</a> as Sasha and Aleksis Kaidanovsky (Russia). <a href="/wiki/Joe_Pingue" title="Joe Pingue">Joe Pingue</a> portrays Captain Merrit, the captain of a fishing boat caught in a battle between Jaeger and Kaiju. <a href="/wiki/Santiago_Segura" title="Santiago Segura">Santiago Segura</a> plays an aide to Hannibal Chau.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Brad_William_Henke" title="Brad William Henke">Brad William Henke</a> and <a href="/wiki/Larry_Joe_Campbell" title="Larry Joe Campbell">Larry Joe Campbell</a> portray members of a construction team Raleigh joins after retiring from the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. <a href="/wiki/Robin_Thomas" title="Robin Thomas">Robin Thomas</a>, Julian Barnes, and <a href="/wiki/David_Richmond-Peck" title="David Richmond-Peck">David Richmond-Peck</a> portray <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">U.N.</a> representatives from the United States, Great Britain, and Canada respectively. <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Pigott" title="Sebastian Pigott">Sebastian Pigott</a> appears as a Jaeger engineer and Joshua Peace appears as an officer, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jonathan_Foxon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jonathan Foxon (page does not exist)">Jonathan Foxon</a> appears as an frantic civilian. <a href="/wiki/David_Fox_(actor)" title="David Fox (actor)">David Fox</a> plays an old man on a beach, while Jane Watson portrays Raleigh and Yancy's mother in a flashback sequence.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> Producer Thomas Tull makes a cameo appearance.<sup id="cite_ref-Wired-Watercutter_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wired-Watercutter-43"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the film, a Jaeger's neural load is too much for a single pilot to handle alone, meaning they must first be psychically linked to another pilota concept called "drifting". When pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate knowledge of each other's memories and feelings, and have no choice but to accept them; del Toro found this concept's dramatic potential compelling. The director expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real life:</p>
<p>The pilots' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that we're all together in the same robot [in life]... Either we get along or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.</p>
<p>Del Toro acknowledged this message's simplicity, but said he would have liked to have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child.<sup id="cite_ref-Boston_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Boston-33"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> The film's ten primary characters all have "little arcs" conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: "I think that's a great message to give kids... 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life... We can only be complete when we work together." The director noted that <i><a href="/wiki/Hellboy_(film)" title="Hellboy (film)">Hellboy</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Backbone" title="The Devil's Backbone">The Devil's Backbone</a></i> told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.<sup id="cite_ref-Beaks1_44-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Beaks1-44"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The film centers on the relationship between Becket and Mori, but is not a love story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot their Jaeger, they undergo a process of "opening up", gaining access to each other's thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one of respect and "perfect trust". Hunnam commented that the film is "a love story without a love story. It's about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself".<sup id="cite_ref-trauma_20-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-trauma-20"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> Both Becket and Mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script's central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically "become one", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> Del Toro emphasized the characters' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the way he would a sex scene.<sup id="cite_ref-timeout-QA_47-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-timeout-QA-47"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Del Toro, a self-described <a href="/wiki/Pacifist" title="Pacifist" class="mw-redirect">pacifist</a>, avoided what he termed "car commercial aesthetics" or "army recruitment video aesthetics", and gave the characters <a href="/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">Western</a> ranks including "marshal" and "ranger" rather than military ranks such as "captain", "major" or "general". The director stated: "I avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. We have enough firepower in the world."<sup id="cite_ref-Star_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Star-21"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Del Toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction featured in contemporary blockbuster films, and made a point of showing the streets and buildings being evacuated before Kaiju attacks, ensuring that the destruction depicted is "completely remorseless". The director stated:</p>
<p>I don't want people being crushed. I want the joy that I used to get seeing <a href="/wiki/Godzilla" title="Godzilla">Godzilla</a> toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank... What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile the status quo is and the safety of citizens, but in my mindhonestlythis film is in another realm. There is no correlation to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, 'I'm going to destroy Seattle.' In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>that puny humans like us could be 'together'not only in the specific neural melding that must take place between the two Jaeger co-pilots but also, more generally speaking, in a <a href="/wiki/Fractal" title="Fractal">fractal</a> web of resemblance, filling the world with copies of ourselves at varying orders of magnitude and with varying degrees of re-expression, beginning with the shoes on our feet.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

While walking on the beach near <a href="/wiki/Santa_Monica_Pier" title="Santa Monica Pier">Santa Monica Pier</a>, the screenwriter imagined a giant robot and a giant monster fighting to the death. "They just sort of materialized out of the fog, these vast, godlike things." He later conceived the idea that each robot had two pilots, asking "what happens when one of those people dies?"

Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing "looser" movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: "Everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later.

<p>Del Toro envisioned <i>Pacific Rim</i> as an earnest, colorful adventure story, with an "incredibly airy and light feel", in contrast to the "super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie".

<p>The film was to honor the Kaiju and mecha genres while creating an original stand-alone film, something "conscious of the heritage, but not a pastiche or an homage or a greatest hits of everything".

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Two years after the events of the first film, <a href="/wiki/Jason_Bourne" title="Jason Bourne">Jason Bourne</a> and Marie Kreutz are now in <a href="/wiki/Goa" title="Goa">Goa</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>. Still experiencing <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(psychology)" title="Flashback (psychology)">flashbacks</a> about his former life as a <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> assassin, he records them in a notebook.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, CIA agents subordinate to <a href="/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency">Deputy Director</a> Pamela Landy are paying US$3 million for the "Neski files", documents on the theft of $20 million in <a href="/wiki/Black_budget" title="Black budget">allocation money</a> seven years prior. The deal is interrupted by Kirill, an agent for <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Federal_Security_Service" title="Federal Security Service">Federal Security Service</a> who works for Russian oil <a href="/wiki/Russian_oligarchs" title="Russian oligarchs" class="mw-redirect">oligarch</a> Yuri Gretkov. Kirill plants Bourne's fingerprint at the scene, interrupts the deal, kills everyone involved and steals the files and money. He travels to Goa to kill Bourne, but Bourne spots him and flees with Marie. Mistakenly believing Bourne is the driver, Kirill shoots at the driver seat and kills Marie. Their vehicle plunges into a river and Bourne leaves after unsuccessfully attempting to revive Marie.</p>
<p>Bourne travels to <a href="/wiki/Naples,_Italy" title="Naples, Italy" class="mw-redirect">Naples, Italy</a> with money and passports. After finding Bourne's fingerprint that Kirill planted, Landy asks Deputy Director Ward Abbott about Operation Treadstone, the defunct CIA program to which Bourne belonged. She tells Abbott that the CIA agent who stole the $20 million was named in the Neski files. Some years previously, Russian politician Vladimir Neski was about to identify the thief when he was supposedly murdered by his wife in a Berlin hotel. Landy believes that Bourne and Treadstone's late supervisor, Alexander Conklin, were somehow involved. She also believes that Bourne killed her two agents. Both Abbott and Landy go to Berlin to capture Bourne.</p>
<p>In Naples, Bourne allows himself to be identified by security. He subdues his CIA interrogator and <a href="/wiki/SIM_cloning" title="SIM cloning" class="mw-redirect">copies the SIM card</a> from his cell phone. From the subsequent phone call, he learns about Landy and his frame up. Bourne goes to <a href="/wiki/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a> to visit Jarda, the only other remaining Treadstone operative. Jarda informs Bourne that Treadstone was shut down after Conklin's death, and tries to incapacitate him. Bourne kills Jarda and escapes before the CIA arrives. Bourne follows Landy and Abbott as they meet former Treadstone support technician Nicky Parsons to question her about Bourne. Believing that the CIA is hunting him again, Bourne calls Landy from a nearby roof and is told of the reason for his pursuit. He demands a meet-up with Nicky and indicates to Landy that he can see her in the office, shocking the entire CIA team.</p>
<p>Bourne kidnaps Nicky at the meet-up in <a href="/wiki/Alexanderplatz" title="Alexanderplatz">Alexanderplatz</a>, and learns from her that Abbott was the head of Treadstone, not Conklin. He remembers that he murdered Neski in Berlin, but Nicky knows nothing about it, so he lets her go. Bourne then visits the hotel where the killing took place and recalls more of his missionhe killed Neski on Conklin's orders, and when Neski's wife showed up, he shot her to make it look like a <a href="/wiki/Murder%E2%80%93suicide" title="Murdersuicide">murdersuicide</a>. When Danny Zorn (Conklin's assistant) suspects a conspiracy against Bourne, he confides in Abbott, who kills him. Bourne breaks into Abbott's hotel room and records a conversation between him and Gretkov that incriminates them in the theft of the 20 million. Abbott admits to Bourne that he stole the money, ordered Bourne to murder Neski, ordered Kirill to retrieve the files, and have Bourne framed and silenced in Goa. After Bourne leaves, Landy confronts Abbott about her suspicion and he commits suicide. Bourne sends the tape of the confession to Landy, vindicating himself.</p>
<p>Bourne goes to <a href="/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> to find Irena Neski, the daughter of Vladimir Neski. Kirill, tasked once again by Gretkov with killing Bourne, finds and wounds him. Bourne flees on a stolen taxi and Kirill chases him. After a long high-speed chase also involving police vehicles, Bourne forces Kirill's vehicle into a concrete divider. Bourne walks away, leaving a <a href="/wiki/Mortal_wound" title="Mortal wound">mortally wounded</a> Kirill. Gretkov is subsequently arrested. Bourne locates Irena, confesses to murdering her parents and apologizes to her, then leaves.</p>
<p>There were no plans to make a sequel to <i>The Bourne Identity</i> (2002) when it was conceived. Matt Damon commented, "When <i>The Bourne Identity</i> came out I said, 'There is very little chance we will do a second film, just because nobody on the team who made the first wants to make another movie if it can't be as good as, or better than, the first one.<span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" According to producer <a href="/wiki/Frank_Marshall_(film_producer)" title="Frank Marshall (film producer)" class="mw-redirect">Frank Marshall</a>, the plot point of Marie's kidnapping to force Bourne back into his assassin persona in the novel <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i> and Bourne's threat to come after the CIA if they came after him again in the previous film, were the inspiration for the plot. Marshall said that screenwriter <a href="/wiki/Tony_Gilroy" title="Tony Gilroy">Tony Gilroy</a> thought of an idea that Bourne "would go on what amounts to the samurai's journey, this journey of atonement." Producer Paul L. Sandberg felt that Gilroy's "veering away from the plot of the book" was necessary "because so much of the world has changed since the book's publication." The producers replaced director Doug Liman. This was mainly due to the difficulties Liman had with the studio when making the first film, and their unwillingness to work with him again. British director <a href="/wiki/Paul_Greengrass" title="Paul Greengrass">Paul Greengrass</a> was selected to direct the film after the producers saw <i><a href="/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(TV_film)" title="Bloody Sunday (TV film)" class="mw-redirect">Bloody Sunday</a></i> (2002), Greengrass' depiction of the Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland, at Gilroy's suggestion. Producer Patrick Crowley liked Greengrass' "sense of the camera as participatory viewer", a visual style Crowley thought would work well for <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The film was shot in reverse order of its settings: some portions of the car chase and the film's ending were shot in Moscow, then most of the rest of the film was shot in and around Berlin, and the opening scenes in Goa were filmed last.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to a June 2008 article from <i>The Guardian</i>, "Two weeks before [the film's] release, [Greengrass] got together with its star, Matt Damon, came up with a new ending and phoned the producers saying the new idea was way better. And it would cost $200,000 and involve pulling Damon from the set of <i><a href="/wiki/Ocean%27s_Twelve" title="Ocean's Twelve">Ocean's 12</a></i> for a <a href="/wiki/Re-shoot" title="Re-shoot" class="mw-redirect">re-shoot</a>.

Six weeks later, <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> <a href="/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency">Deputy Director</a> Pamela Landy (<a href="/wiki/Joan_Allen" title="Joan Allen">Joan Allen</a>) divulges the audiotaped confession of Ward Abbott, the late former head of Operation Treadstone, to <a href="/wiki/Director_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Director of the Central Intelligence Agency">Director</a> Ezra Kramer (<a href="/wiki/Scott_Glenn" title="Scott Glenn">Scott Glenn</a>). Meanwhile, in <a href="/wiki/Turin" title="Turin">Turin</a>, journalist Simon Ross (<a href="/wiki/Paddy_Considine" title="Paddy Considine">Paddy Considine</a>) of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> meets an informant to learn about Jason and Operation Blackbriar, the program succeeding Treadstone. The CIA tracks Ross as he returns to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, after his mention of "Blackbriar" during a cell-phone call to his editor is detected by the <a href="/wiki/ECHELON" title="ECHELON">ECHELON</a> system. Jason reappears in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> to inform Martin Kreutz (<a href="/wiki/Daniel_Br%C3%BChl" title="Daniel Brhl">Daniel Brhl</a>), the step-brother of his girlfriend Marie Helena Kreutz (<a href="/wiki/Franka_Potente" title="Franka Potente">Franka Potente</a>) of her assassination in <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>.</p>
<p>Jason reads Ross's articles and arranges a meeting with him at <a href="/wiki/London_Waterloo_station" title="London Waterloo station">London Waterloo station</a>. Jason realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture, but Ross ignores Jason's instructions, despite warning him and is quickly assassinated by Blackbriar assassin Paz (<a href="/wiki/Edgar_Ramirez" title="Edgar Ramirez" class="mw-redirect">Edgar Ramirez</a>), on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (<a href="/wiki/David_Straithairn" title="David Straithairn" class="mw-redirect">David Straithairn</a>) right in front of the crowd of citizens. Vosen's team, reluctantly assisted by Landy, analyzes Ross's notes and realize Neal Daniels (<a href="/wiki/Colin_Stinton" title="Colin Stinton">Colin Stinton</a>), a CIA <a href="/wiki/Station_chief" title="Station chief">Station chief</a> involved with Treadstone and Blackbriar, was his source. Jason makes his way to Daniels's office in <a href="/wiki/Madrid" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> but finds it empty. He incapacitates gunmen sent by Vosen and Landy. Nicolette "Nicky" Parsons (<a href="/wiki/Julia_Stiles" title="Julia Stiles">Julia Stiles</a>), a former Treadstone technician who shares a history with Jason, tells him that Daniels has fled to <a href="/wiki/Tangier" title="Tangier">Tangier</a> and aids his escape from an arriving CIA unit.</p>
<p>Nicky learns that Blackbriar "asset" Desh Bouksani (<a href="/wiki/Joey_Ansah" title="Joey Ansah">Joey Ansah</a>) has been tasked with killing Daniels. Vosen sees that Nicky accessed information about Daniels and sends Bouksani after Nicky and Jason as well, a decision with which Landy fiercely disagrees. Jason follows Bouksani to Daniels but fails to prevent Daniels's death by a planted bomb. However, Jason manages to kill Bouksani before he can kill Nicky. After sending Nicky into hiding, Jason examines the contents of Daniels's briefcase and finds the address of the deep-cover CIA bureau in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where Vosen directs Blackbriar. Jason travels to New York.</p>
<p>Landy receives a phone call from Jason, which is intercepted by Vosen. Landy tells him that his real name is David Webb and mentions "4-15-71". Bourne tells Landy to "get some rest" because she "look[s] tired", tipping off his presence in New York. Vosen intercepts a text to Landy from Jason, apparently of a location to meet up and leaves his office with a <a href="/wiki/Extraordinary_rendition" title="Extraordinary rendition">rendition</a> team to capture him. Instead, Jason enters Vosen's office and takes classified Blackbriar documents. Realizing that he has been hoodwinked, Vosen sends Paz after Jason, resulting in Paz forcing Jason's car to crash into a concrete barrier. Jason holds Paz at gunpoint before sparing his life.</p>
<p>Jason arrives at a hospital at 415 East 71st Street, memories of which were triggered by the numbers that Landy had given him earlier. Outside, Jason meets Landy and gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Vosen figures out Landy's code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch (<a href="/wiki/Albert_Finney" title="Albert Finney">Albert Finney</a>), who ran Treadstone's <a href="/wiki/Behavior_modification" title="Behavior modification">behavior modification</a> program, that Jason is coming. He follows Landy inside the building but is too late to stop her from faxing the Blackbriar documents out. Meanwhile, Jason encounters Hirsch on an upper floor and, with Hirsch's help, remembers that he volunteered for Treadstone. As Jason flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, "Why didn't you take the shot?" Jason repeats the dying words of <a href="/wiki/The_Bourne_Identity_(2002_film)" title="The Bourne Identity (2002 film)">The Professor</a>: "Look at us. Look at what they make you give." Paz lowers his gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Jason as he collapses into the <a href="/wiki/East_River" title="East River">East River</a>.</p>
<p>Some time later, Nicky watches a news broadcast about the exposure of Operation Blackbriar, the arrests of Hirsch and Vosen, a criminal investigation against Kramer, and the whereabouts of David Webb a.k.a. Jason Bourne. Upon hearing that his body has not been found after a three-day search of the river, Nicky smiles. Jason is shown having survived from his attempted killing and swims away.</p>

<p>Paul Greengrass spoke about the characterization of Jason Bourne in <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i> shortly before its release:</p>
<p>Bourne is a real man in a real world in pursuit of a mythic quest. What's wonderful is that it's an oppositional story. Is he a killer, or was he made to be a killer? There is an underlying feeling that Bourne is one of us, and he's running away from "them." He's trying to get answers, and he doesn't trust them. They're all bad, and the system's corrupted. To convey that with a sense of excitement in a very contemporary land-scape is great fun. [...] If you opened your door in New York or Paris or London or whatever, you've got to believe that whatever the story it is that Bourne's engaged in [, something] could be happening there. [...] What attracts me to Bourne's world is that it is a real world and I think I'm most comfortable there.<sup id="cite_ref-Dodds_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dodds-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>I think in terms of another one, the story of this guy's search for his identity is over, because he's got all the answers, so there's no way we can trot out the same character, and so much of what makes him interesting is that internal struggle that was happening for him, am I a good guy, am I a bad guy, what is the secret behind my identity, what am I blocking out, why am I remembering these disturbing images? So all of that internal propulsive mechanism that drives the character is not there, so if there was to be another one then it would have to be a complete reconfiguration, you know, where do you go from there? For me I kind of feel like the story that we set out to tell is has now been told. I love the character, and if Paul Greengrass calls me in ten years and says, 'Now we can do it, because it's been ten years and I have a way to bring him back,' then there's a world in which I can go, 'Yeah, absolutely.'

<p></p>
<p>Growing up in <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, Chris Kyle is taught by his father how to shoot a rifle and hunt deer. Years later, Chris has become a ranch hand and <a href="/wiki/Rodeo" title="Rodeo">rodeo</a> cowboy, and returns home early, to find his girlfriend in bed with another man. After telling her to leave, he is mulling it over with his brother when he sees news coverage of the <a href="/wiki/1998_U.S._embassy_bombings" title="1998 U.S. embassy bombings" class="mw-redirect">1998 U.S. embassy bombings</a> and decides to enlist in the Navy. He qualifies for special training and becomes a <a href="/wiki/U.S._Navy_SEALs" title="U.S. Navy SEALs" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Navy SEALs</a> sniper.</p>
<p>Chris meets Taya Renae at a bar, and the two soon marry. He is sent to <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> after the <a href="/wiki/September_11_attacks" title="September 11 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>. His first kills are a woman and boy who attacked U.S. Marines with a Russian made <a href="/wiki/RKG-3_anti-tank_grenade" title="RKG-3 anti-tank grenade">RKG-3 anti-tank grenade</a>. Chris is visibly upset by the experience but later earns the nickname "Legend" for his many kills. Assigned to hunt for the <a href="/wiki/Al-Qaeda" title="Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> leader <a href="/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi" title="Abu Musab al-Zarqawi">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, Chris interrogates a family whose father offers to lead the SEALs to "The Butcher", al-Zarqawi's second-in-command. The plan goes awry when The Butcher captures the father and his son, killing them while Chris is pinned down by a sniper using a Romanian <a href="/wiki/PSL_(rifle)" title="PSL (rifle)">PSL</a> <a href="/wiki/Sniper_rifle" title="Sniper rifle">sniper rifle</a>. This sniper goes by the name Mustafa and is an <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Games" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> medalist from <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a>. Meanwhile, the insurgents issue a bounty on Chris.</p>
<p>Chris returns home to his wife and the birth of his son. He is distracted by memories of his war experiences and by Tayas concern for them as a couple; she wishes he would focus on his home and family.</p>
<p>Chris leaves for a second tour and is promoted to <a href="/wiki/Chief_Petty_Officer" title="Chief Petty Officer" class="mw-redirect">Chief Petty Officer</a>. Involved in a shootout with The Butcher, he helps in killing him. When he returns home to a newborn daughter, Chris becomes increasingly distant from his family. On Chris' third tour, Mustafa seriously injures a unit member, Ryan "Biggles" Job, and the unit is evacuated back to base. When they decide to return to the field and continue the mission, another SEAL, <a href="/wiki/Marc_Alan_Lee" title="Marc Alan Lee">Marc Lee</a>, is killed by gunfire.</p>
<p>Guilt compels Chris to undertake a fourth tour, and Taya tells him that she may not be there when he returns. Back in Iraq, Chris is assigned to kill Mustafa, who has been sniping U.S. Army combat engineers building a barricade. Chris' sniper team is placed on a rooftop inside enemy territory. Chris spots Mustafa and takes him out with a risky long distance shot at 2100 yards (1920 meters), but this exposes his team's position to numerous armed insurgents. In the midst of the firefight, and low on ammunition, Chris tearfully calls Taya and tells her he is ready to come home. A sandstorm provides cover for a chaotic escape in which Chris is injured and almost left behind.</p>
<p>After Chris gets back, on edge and unable to adjust fully to civilian life, he is asked by a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs" title="United States Department of Veterans Affairs">Veterans Affairs</a> psychiatrist if he is haunted by all the things he did in war. When he replies that it is all the guys [he] couldn't save" that haunt him, the psychiatrist encourages him to help severely wounded veterans in the VA hospital. After that Chris gradually begins to adjust to home life.</p>
<p>Years later, on February 2, 2013, a happy Chris says goodbye to his wife and family as he leaves to spend time with a veteran at a shooting range.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Author Gordie Lachance (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss" title="Richard Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>) writes about a childhood incident when he and three buddies undertook a journey to find the body of a missing boy near the town of <a href="/wiki/Castle_Rock,_Tillamook_County,_Oregon" title="Castle Rock, Tillamook County, Oregon">Castle Rock, Oregon</a> over <a href="/wiki/Labor_Day" title="Labor Day">Labor Day</a> weekend in 1959.</p>
<p>Young Gordie (<a href="/wiki/Wil_Wheaton" title="Wil Wheaton">Wil Wheaton</a>) is a quiet, bookish boy with a penchant for writing and telling stories. His parents, grieving the recent death of Gordie's older brother, neglect their youngest son. To cope, Gordie spends much time with his friends: Chris Chambers (<a href="/wiki/River_Phoenix" title="River Phoenix">River Phoenix</a>), whose family are criminals and alcoholics; Teddy Duchamp (<a href="/wiki/Corey_Feldman" title="Corey Feldman">Corey Feldman</a>), an eccentric and physically scarred boy; and Vern Tessio (<a href="/wiki/Jerry_O%27Connell" title="Jerry O'Connell">Jerry O'Connell</a>), who is overweight and timid, often making him the target of <a href="/wiki/Bullying" title="Bullying">bullying</a>.</p>
<p>Vern overhears his older brother, Billy (<a href="/wiki/Casey_Siemaszko" title="Casey Siemaszko">Casey Siemaszko</a>), and Billy's friend, Charlie Hogan (<a href="/wiki/Gary_Riley" title="Gary Riley">Gary Riley</a>), discussing Ray Brower, a young boy who was reportedly struck and killed by a train. They want to search for the body, but Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern decide to follow the local rail line and find Ray first, and making them local heroes. Chris steals his father's <a href="/wiki/M1911_pistol" title="M1911 pistol">M1911 pistol</a> and he, Gordie, Vern and Teddy head out on the train tracks.</p>
<p>The boys stop at a nearby junkyard to get a drink using a pump. The junkyard owner is notorious around Castle Rock for being the owner of a vicious and rarely seen dog, Chopper, famous for being able to attack certain parts of the human anatomy. They hang out in the junkyard for a while when the boys send Gordie out to buy food at a nearby general store. When Gordie returns, he sees the other three boys jumping the fence. Gordie walks over to join them, but Milo Pressman, the junkman, spots him and sends Chopper after him. Gordie runs and jumps the fence with Chopper in close pursuit, nearly escaping the dog. The boys discover that Chopper is a small dog and could easily be overthrown by an adolescent. They tease Chopper, but Pressman arrives and calls Teddy's father a loony, inciting Teddy's rage, causing the other boys to keep him from killing Pressman. Teddy is saddened by the insult, and Vern, Chris and Gordie help him.</p>
<p>At nighttime, Gordie tells the other boys a story of Davie "Lard-Ass" Hogan, an overweight boy who is constantly teased and bullied. He was born with a glandular condition which caused him to become obese and overweight, resulting in other kids and family members ridiculing and teasing him. Hogan enters a pie-eating contest, but his main goal was not to win, but to exact revenge. Prior to the contest, Hogan had consumed <a href="/wiki/Castor_oil" title="Castor oil">castor oil</a> and a raw <a href="/wiki/Egg" title="Egg">egg</a>, working as <a href="/wiki/Vomiting#Emetics" title="Vomiting">emetics</a>, planning to vomit on one of the other contestants, triggering a chain reaction of every witness vomiting, the majority being the bullies which had abused him earlier. After eating a fifth pie, he vomits, inducing the vomiting of all the crowd members, resulting in humiliation and embarrassment of his tormentors. The boys are impressed with the story, but are disappointed with the end.</p>
<p>After a series of misadventures and much self-revelation, the boys locate the body. However, local hoodlum "Ace" Merrill (<a href="/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland" title="Kiefer Sutherland">Kiefer Sutherland</a>) and his gang including Chris' older brother "Eyeball" (<a href="/wiki/Bradley_Gregg" title="Bradley Gregg">Bradley Gregg</a>), Billy, Charlie, Vince Desjardins (Jason Oliver) and two other gang members arrive in cars to claim the body and the credit for finding it. When Chris refuses to step aside, Ace attempts to kill him until Gordie threatens to shoot Ace with the pistol from before. Outmatched, Ace and his gang retreat. The boys agree to report the body via an anonymous phone call to the authorities. They hike back to Castle Rock, bid each other farewell until they see each other in a few days at Junior High School.</p>
<p>The present-day Gordie writes that the friends drifted apart shortly thereafter. Vern married immediately after high school, had four children, and drives a forklift at a local lumber yard. Teddy tried enlisting in the army but was turned down due to his ear injury and impaired eyesight. He had served some time in prison and now does odd jobs around Castle Rock. Chris went on to college and became a lawyer. When attempting to break up a fight in a fast-food restaurant, he was fatally stabbed in the neck. Gordie finishes his memoir and takes his son and friend swimming.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, Italian fishermen rescue an unconscious American man (<a href="/wiki/Matt_Damon" title="Matt Damon">Matt Damon</a>) floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, and when the man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative amnesia: he has no idea of his identity but is aware of advanced combat skills and fluent in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's skin that, when activated, gives a number of a <a href="/wiki/Safe_deposit_box" title="Safe deposit box">safe deposit box</a> in <a href="/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich" title="Zrich">Zrich</a>. Upon landing, the man heads to investigate the box. Arriving at the bank, the man finds the box contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards, and a handgun; the man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use the name on the American passport, <a href="/wiki/Jason_Bourne" title="Jason Bourne">Jason Bourne</a>.</p>
<p>A bank employee contacts Operation Treadstone, a <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> <a href="/wiki/Black_operation" title="Black operation">black operation</a> program after Bourne's departure. Treadstone's head, Alexander Conklin (<a href="/wiki/Chris_Cooper" title="Chris Cooper">Chris Cooper</a>), contacts CIA <a href="/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency">Deputy Director</a> Ward Abbott (<a href="/wiki/Brian_Cox_(actor)" title="Brian Cox (actor)">Brian Cox</a>) about the reappearance of Bourne. Abbott warns that Bourne, a CIA agent, had been assigned the silent assassination of exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (<a href="/wiki/Adewale_Akinnuoye-Agbaje" title="Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje">Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje</a>), but the attempt failed, and Bourne must be dealt with. Conklin activates three agents to take down Bourne: Castel (Nicky Naude), Manheim (Russell Levy), and the Professor (<a href="/wiki/Clive_Owen" title="Clive Owen">Clive Owen</a>), while also issuing alerts to local police to capture Bourne.</p>
<p>Bourne attempts to get more information from the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Consul_(representative)#Consulates_and_embassies" title="Consul (representative)">consulate</a>, but he is discovered by guards. He evades capture, leaves the embassy, and gives a German woman, Marie Helena Kreutz (<a href="/wiki/Franka_Potente" title="Franka Potente">Franka Potente</a>), $20,000 to drive him to an address in Paris listed on his French driving license. At the address, an apartment, he hits redial on the phone and reaches a hotel. He inquires about the names on his passports there, learning that a "John Michael Kane" had been registered but died two weeks prior in a car accident. Castel ambushes them in the apartment, but Bourne gets the upper hand. Instead of allowing himself to be interrogated, Castel throws himself out a window to his death. Kreutz finds wanted posters of Bourne and herself, and agrees to continue to help Bourne.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wombosi approaches the police about the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, had planted a body in the Paris morgue to appear as the assailant, but Wombosi is not fooled and threatens to report this. The Professor assassinates Wombosi on Conklin's orders. Bourne, posing as Kane, learns about Wombosi's yacht, and that the assailant had been shot twice during the escape; Bourne now considers himself to have been the assailant. He and Kreutz take refuge at the French countryside home of her ex-lover Eamon (<a href="/wiki/Tim_Dutton" title="Tim Dutton">Tim Dutton</a>) and his children. Conklin tracks their position and sends the Professor there, but Bourne mortally wounds him. The Professor reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. He sends Kreutz, Eamon and his children away for their protection, and then contacts Conklin via the Professor's phone to arrange a meet. From a rooftop near the arranged location in Paris, Bourne sees Conklin has brought backup, so abandons the meeting but uses the opportunity to place a tracking device on his car, leading him to the Treadstone's <a href="/wiki/Safe_house" title="Safe house">safe house</a>.</p>
<p>Bourne breaks in and holds Conklin and logistics technician Nicolette "Nicky" Parsons (<a href="/wiki/Julia_Stiles" title="Julia Stiles">Julia Stiles</a>) at gunpoint. Bourne starts to recall fully the assassination attempt through successive <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(psychology)" title="Flashback (psychology)">flashbacks</a>. As Kane, and working under orders from Treadstone, Bourne infiltrated Wombosi's yacht but could not bring himself to kill Wombosi while Wombosi's children were present, and instead fled, being shot at during his escape. Bourne announces he is resigning from Treadstone and not to be followed. As agents descend on the safehouse, Bourne fights his way free. Meanwhile, when Conklin goes to leave the safe house, he is killed by Manheim, who was ordered to terminate Treadstone by Abbott.</p>
<p>Abbott reports on the dismissal of Treadstone before an oversight committee but announces a new project codenamed "Blackbriar". Some time later, Bourne finds Kreutz renting out <a href="/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)" title="Scooter (motorcycle)">scooters</a> to tourists on <a href="/wiki/Mykonos" title="Mykonos">Mykonos</a>, and the two reunite.</p>
<p>Director Doug Liman stated that he had been a fan of the source novel by Robert Ludlum since he read it in high school. Near the end of production of Liman's previous film <i><a href="/wiki/Swingers_(1996_film)" title="Swingers (1996 film)">Swingers</a></i>, Liman decided to develop a film adaptation of the novel. After more than two years of securing rights to the book from <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> and a further year of screenplay development with screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the film went through two years of production.<sup id="cite_ref-DVD.com_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DVD.com-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Pictures</a> acquired the film rights to Ludlum's books in the hopes of starting a new film franchise.<sup id="cite_ref-Pitt_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pitt-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/William_Blake_Herron" title="William Blake Herron">William Blake Herron</a> was brought in to rewrite the script in 1999.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The inner workings of the fictitious Treadstone organization were inspired by Liman's father's job in the <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) under <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. Of particular inspiration were Liman's father's memoirs regarding his involvement in the investigation of the <a href="/wiki/Iran-Contra_affair" title="Iran-Contra affair" class="mw-redirect">Iran-Contra affair</a>. Many aspects of the Alexander Conklin character were based on his father's recollections of <a href="/wiki/Oliver_North" title="Oliver North">Oliver North</a>. Liman admitted that he jettisoned much of the content of the novel beyond the central premise, in order to modernize the material and to conform it to his own beliefs regarding United States foreign policy. However, Liman was careful not to cram his political views down "the audience's throat". There were initial concerns regarding the film's possible obsolescence and overall reception in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/September_11_attacks" title="September 11 attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, but these concerns proved groundless.<sup id="cite_ref-DVD.com_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DVD.com-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Liman approached a wide range of actors for the role of Bourne, including <a href="/wiki/Brad_Pitt" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Pitt_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pitt-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> who turned it down to star in <i><a href="/wiki/Spy_Game" title="Spy Game">Spy Game</a></i>,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> as well as <a href="/wiki/Russell_Crowe" title="Russell Crowe">Russell Crowe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone" title="Sylvester Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>, before he eventually cast Damon. Liman found that Damon understood and appreciated that, though <i>The Bourne Identity</i> would have its share of action, the focus was primarily on character and plot.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BBC-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Damon, who had never played such a physically demanding role, insisted on performing many of the stunts himself.

<p>From the onset of filming, difficulties with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal Pictures, as executives were unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement.<sup id="cite_ref-Wall_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wall-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development and scheduling problems delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter <a href="/wiki/Tony_Gilroy" title="Tony Gilroy">Tony Gilroy</a> faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming.<sup id="cite_ref-Wall_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wall-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> A particular point of contention with regard to the original Gilroy script were the scenes set in the farmhouse near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were low key, they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.<sup id="cite_ref-Wall_9-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wall-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Other issues included the studio's desire to substitute <a href="/wiki/Montreal" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> or <a href="/wiki/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a> for Paris in order to lower costs, Liman's insistence on the use of a French-speaking film crew, and poor test audience reactions to the film's Paris finale.

<p>Liman's directorial method was often hands-on. Many times he operated the camera himself in order to create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.<sup id="cite_ref-DVDDocumentary_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DVDDocumentary-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The unit shot in various locations around Paris while Liman was filming the main story arc elsewhere in the city. The finished footage was eventually edited together to create the illusion of a coherent journey.

<p>The score for the Bourne Identity was composed by <a href="/wiki/John_Powell_(composer)" title="John Powell (composer)" class="mw-redirect">John Powell</a>. Powell was bought in to replace Carter Burwell, who had composed and recorded a more traditional orchestral score for the film, which director Doug Liman rejected. Since a lot of the music budget had been spent recording the rejected score, Powell's score was initially conceived to be entirely non-orchestral, making extensive use of percussion, guitars, electronics and studio techniques. However, a string section was later overdubbed onto many of the cues to give them a 'cinematic' quality. <sup id="cite_ref-Empire_magazine_interview_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Empire_magazine_interview-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Although this film has the same title as Van Lustbader's first <i>Bourne</i> novel, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Bourne_Legacy_(novel)" title="The Bourne Legacy (novel)">The Bourne Legacy</a></i>, the actual screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel. Unlike the novel, which features Jason Bourne as the principal character, the film centers on <a href="/wiki/Black_operation" title="Black operation">Black ops</a> agent Aaron Cross (played by <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Renner" title="Jeremy Renner">Jeremy Renner</a>), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Weisz" title="Rachel Weisz">Rachel Weisz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edward_Norton" title="Edward Norton">Edward Norton</a>.</p>
<p>The titular character Jason Bourne does not appear in <i>The Bourne Legacy</i>, because actor <a href="/wiki/Matt_Damon" title="Matt Damon">Matt Damon</a>, who played Bourne in the first three films, chose not to return for a fourth film. However, there are various pictures of Damon as Bourne shown throughout the film, and his name is mentioned several times. Tony Gilroy, co-screenwriter of the first three films, sought to continue the story of the film series without changing its key events, and parts of <i>The Bourne Legacy</i> take place at the same time as the previous film, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Bourne_Ultimatum_(film)" title="The Bourne Ultimatum (film)">The Bourne Ultimatum</a></i> (2007).</p>
<p>In <i>The Bourne Legacy</i>, Aaron Cross is a member of a black ops program called Operation Outcome whose subjects are genetically enhanced. He must run for his life once former CIA Treadstone agent <a href="/wiki/Jason_Bourne" title="Jason Bourne">Jason Bourne</a>'s actions lead to the public exposure of Operation Treadstone and its successor Operation Blackbriar.</p>
<p>Filming was primarily in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a>, with some scenes shot in the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Released on <span class="nowrap">August 10</span>, 2012, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the story and Renner's performance, but expressed disappointment in Matt Damon's absence as well as the lack of shaky camera work that the <a href="/wiki/The_Bourne_Supremacy_(film)" title="The Bourne Supremacy (film)">second</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Bourne_Ultimatum_(film)" title="The Bourne Ultimatum (film)">third</a> films had utilized.</p>

Byer discovers a potentially scandalous video on the Internet showing Hirsch socializing with Dr. Dan Hillcott (Neil Brooks Cunningham), Outcome's medical director.

Marta reveals that Cross has been <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetically modified</a> by a tailored virus to retain the physical benefits without needing the green chems anymore.

It is the second feature by <a href="/wiki/Bellwether_Pictures" title="Bellwether Pictures">Bellwether Pictures</a>. <i>In Your Eyes</i>, set in <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, follows Dylan and Rebecca. They live on opposite sides of the country, but are able to sense what the other is feeling - despite being strangers.</p>
<p>The film had its world premiere at the 2014 <a href="/wiki/Tribeca_Film_Festival" title="Tribeca Film Festival">Tribeca Film Festival</a> on April 20. Immediately afterwards, it was <a href="/wiki/Simultaneous_release" title="Simultaneous release">self-distributed</a> online instead of taking on theatrical distribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The film opens with a young Rebecca Porter about to go sledding in New Hampshire, while across the country in New Mexico, a young Dylan Kershaw is at school with a group of his friends. Suddenly, without even knowing what is happening or why, Dylan is able to experience everything that Rebecca experiences, and at the exact moment that Rebecca crashes her sled, rendering her unconscious, Dylan is thrown from his desk and is knocked out cold.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, Rebecca (<a href="/wiki/Zoe_Kazan" title="Zoe Kazan">Zoe Kazan</a>) is married to a successful doctor, Phillip Porter (<a href="/wiki/Mark_Feuerstein" title="Mark Feuerstein">Mark Feuerstein</a>), while Dylan (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Stahl-David" title="Michael Stahl-David">Michael Stahl-David</a>) has just recently gotten out of prison. One night, Rebecca attends a dinner party with her husband, and Dylan is at a local bar trying to stay out of trouble. However, a man who he had been playing pool with earlier hits him on the back with a pool stick. The impact flings Rebecca to the floor, which she cannot explain to the host of the dinner party, and leads to her husband chastising her for her behavior.</p>
<p>The next day, Dylan and Becky connect once more and they learn that if they speak aloud they can hear one another, they can see what the other is looking at, and feel what the other is feeling. They establish that they are not just figments of their respective imaginations, and they are indeed actual people. They set a meeting time to talk later on that night, and they slowly begin to get to know one another through several scenes where they talk, show each other their surroundings, share their dreams and shared experiences, finally stepping in front of mirrors for a visual introduction.</p>
<p>Throughout their experiences (Becky's fundraiser, Dylan's date, etc.) they grow closer. Becky realizes that Dylan is in love with her and she herself is falling in love with him, so she tries to break off their communication, much to their despair. At the same time, circumstances are closing in on the both of them. Becky's husband feels she has grown distant from him, and he is puzzled and disturbed by her odd behavior he has seen when she has been in mental contact with Dylan. One of her friends, thinking that Becky is either having an affair or is cracking up, brings her suspicions to him, and he and a medical colleague have her forcibly institutionalized. Dylan, on the other hand, loses his post-prison job working in a car wash when customers see him seemingly talking to himself as if he were crazy, when in fact, he was speaking to Becky. At the same time, while he is trying to make a clean break from his criminal past, he is menaced by two long-time criminal acquaintances trying to pressure him into using his skills as a burglar to help them commit a big heist.</p>
<p>Later, Dylan feels that Becky is in trouble and he violates his parole by stealing a truck to get to the airport and leaving the state without permission, taking a plane to New Hampshire to rescue Becky from the mental institution. Unable to rent a car at the airport, Dylan steals one. While she telepathically guides him over what are to him unfamiliar roads between the airport and the institution, he uses his criminal smarts to guide Becky through her escape from the facility, including picking a lock on a door. Becky avoids detection until reaching the front door, where she runs into her husband and subsequently punches him in the face before fleeing the facility, while Dylan is being chased by several police cars. They both manage to elude their respective pursuers and end up on foot running through the woods towards a train. They run alongside the moving train from opposite sides of the track and manage to climb into an empty box car, where they finally unite in person.</p>

<p>The film opens with a short scene from the "current" day in 2006, which appears later on, before going back 18 years.</p>
<p>Dexter Mayhew (<a href="/wiki/Jim_Sturgess" title="Jim Sturgess">Jim Sturgess</a>) and Emma Morley (<a href="/wiki/Anne_Hathaway" title="Anne Hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a>) meet on 14 July 1988 after their graduation from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>. They spend the night together but agree to be just friends, and plan to spend the following day together, the 15th, St. <a href="/wiki/Swithun" title="Swithun">Swithun</a>'s day. The film chronologically reconnects Dexter, Emma or both of them on that one day over the next 18 years after they go their separate ways.</p>
<p>One year later in 1989, Dexter helps Emma move into a flat in London where she plans to pursue a career as a writer. However, after little success, she ends up working as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant by 1990, and meets Ian (<a href="/wiki/Rafe_Spall" title="Rafe Spall">Rafe Spall</a>), an aspiring comedian who is hired soon after. Dexter is travelling the world while drinking and having sex promiscuously with a succession of girlfriends, but they keep in contact via phonecalls and letters. He then visits Emma on 15 July 1991 and, to get her out of her rut, suggests they go away for the weekend. They flirt back and forth and it's made clear that Emma may have deeper feelings for him, but since she knows that Dexter is not boyfriend material, nothing comes of it and two more years fly by. Dexter is now a wealthy and successful television presenter on a raucous late-night television show, where he meets Sylvie (<a href="/wiki/Romola_Garai" title="Romola Garai">Romola Garai</a>), who later becomes his new girlfriend.</p>
<p>Dexter visits his parents on 15 July 1994 after his mother (<a href="/wiki/Patricia_Clarkson" title="Patricia Clarkson">Patricia Clarkson</a>) has been diagnosed with cancer and is terminally ill. He arrives at the family home still under the influence of drugs and alcohol from heavy partying the night before, which his father (<a href="/wiki/Ken_Stott" title="Ken Stott">Ken Stott</a>) notices and is furious about, telling Dexter he will ban him from visiting again if he keeps it up. Also, his mother appears very unimpressed with the nature of his television show and reveals that she no longer believes he is a nice man. On the same day, Emma goes out on a date with Ian. Although there appears to be no romantic spark between them, she knows he means well and so they continue to date anyway.</p>
<p>By 1995, Emma is now a school teacher and has moved in with Ian. However, she grows more and more irritated with him because of his lack of ambition and failure to contribute to maintaining their household. Dexter is the presenter of another television show, which isn't doing so well, making him "the most annoying man on telly". On 15 July 1996, he and Emma meet for dinner. He turns up high on <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, leaves the table every thirty minutes, flirts with another woman down the hall, and insults Emma. She storms off and, out in the street, decides that they must break off their friendship due to them outgrowing each other. She tells him that although she loves him, she no longer likes him anymore.</p>
<p>Two years later, Dexter's television career has gone into a steep decline because he is 32 years old and television executives prefer presenters in their early 20s. Meanwhile, Emma and Ian have split up and she becomes a published author of children's books. By 1999, Dexter is in a long-term relationship with Sylvie. On 15 July 2000, Emma's former university roommate and Dexter's old best friend get married, and both Emma and Dexter are invited to the wedding. There, Dexter receives a job offer from Calum, his old roommate who has since become a multimillionaire from owning a chain of <a href="/wiki/Organic_food" title="Organic food">organic food</a> restaurants. Dexter and Emma leave the party to talk on the rooftop, where he tells her about Sylvie, who is now his fiance, and is on his way to becoming a father. Emma tries to hide the fact that she is upset and they share a very brief but meaningful kiss.</p>
<p>By 2001, Dexter is a father but later learns that Sylvie is having an affair with Calum and they divorce. Two years pass and Emma has moved to Paris, where Dexter visits her on 15 July in the hope that they will get together again, this time for good. It is revealed that they had a one-night stand after his marriage to Sylvie broke down. However, Emma reveals that she has a new boyfriend (<a href="/w/index.php?title=S%C3%A9bastien_Dupuis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sbastien Dupuis (page does not exist)">Sbastien Dupuis</a>), a French musician who plays piano in a jazz band. Smitten with Emma but taken aback by the revelation that she has moved on, Dexter decides to leave. Suddenly, she has second thoughts and chases after him, exclaiming that she thought she had gotten rid of him. He promises to never hurt, lie to or cheat on her, and they share a passionate kiss and finally start a full relationship together.</p>
<p>Emma and Dexter become engaged in 2004 and eventually marry. Parlaying his restaurant experience into a new career, Dexter opens his own cafe in England, which proves to be very lucrative, and he and Emma start trying to have their own baby. However, they are unsuccessful and become frustrated with one another. On 15 July 2006 (the scene from the very beginning of the movie), Emma is hit by a truck while riding her bicycle out of a blind alley, and she dies. Dexter becomes inconsolable and self-destructive, and is particularly desolate each year on their day. Over the years, he gets support from his ex-wife, their daughter Jasmine, his widowed father, and even Ian, who also mourns Emma every year. Ian has since married and had children, but he visits Dexter and tells him that Emma was never the same with him as she was with Dexter, that she "lit up" whenever Dexter was around, and that "she made you decent and you made her so happy".</p>
<p>On 15 July 2011, Dexter visits <a href="/wiki/Arthur%27s_Seat" title="Arthur's Seat">Arthur's Seat</a> in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> with Jasmine. The movie flashbacks to 1988 when they met and reveals they spent their day together at the same place. At the top, Dexter and Emma promise to always be best friends.</p>

<p>Actress Anne Hathaway said she was clandestinely given the script as the film was set in the United Kingdom and director Scherfig wasn't looking for any American actresses for the part. Hathaway flew to London for a meeting with Scherfig to explain why she should get the part. Hathaway later said it was "the worst meeting of my life... I was just inarticulate", but on leaving Hathaway wrote out a list of songs for Scherfig to listen to, saying, "I clearly didn't communicate to you what I needed to today. But I think these songs can do it for me." Scherfig did listen to them, which led to Hathaway getting the part.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>A graduate student, Ian Gray, is researching the evolution of human eyes with Karen, his first year lab assistant, and Kenny. He has a particular hostility to superstition and "<a href="/wiki/Intelligent_design" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a>", which he hopes to discredit by filling in the steps of <a href="/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye" title="Evolution of the eye">the evolution of the eye</a>. At a Halloween party he has an encounter with Sofi, who is wearing a mask. He photographs her eyes and they go into the washroom to have sex. Abruptly she leaves.</p>
<p>Ian continues thinking about her. One day coincidences seem to mysteriously guide him to a billboard displaying what he recognizes to be Sofi's eyes. Eventually he sees her on a train. They begin a relationship, although his rationalism clashes with her fey spirituality. One day they agree to marry. They are told they need to wait a day for a licence, and Ian gets a call from Karen at the lab. There has been a breakthrough in their research. She's found a blind worm  <i><a href="/wiki/Eisenia_fetida" title="Eisenia fetida">Eisenia fetida</a></i>  with the DNA to develop an eye. Ian takes Sofi to the lab with him.</p>
<p>Sofi is upset by the research they're doing and Karen leaves. Sofi kisses Ian and knocks over a bottle of formaldehyde, splashing his eyes. They call Karen, who helps him to the eyewash station and bandages his eyes, and Sofi takes him home. Then the elevator in Sofi's apartment building stops between floors. As they try to climb out the elevator starts to move again and Sofi is killed. Ian goes into a depression, and Karen continues their research. One night Karen brings him a meal at his home. He begins to cry and she hugs him. They begin to kiss.</p>
<p>The film flashes forward seven years. Ian has written a book on the evolution of the eye that he claims further debunks creationism. Ian and Karen are now married and Karen is pregnant. When their baby is born, the hospital takes an <a href="/wiki/Iris_scan" title="Iris scan" class="mw-redirect">iris scan</a> of him. The results are entered in the database and the program identifies the baby as a certain Paul Edgar Dairy. The nurse re-enters the results and the problem disappears.</p>
<p>A few months later, a Doctor Simmons calls, claiming that a test of the baby's urine may indicate an elevated risk of <a href="/wiki/Autism" title="Autism">autism</a> and recommending a further test. But Ian and Karen become suspicious during this test and decide to investigate Doctor Simmons. They find that she is in fact one of a few people with full access to the iris scan database. Ian tracks some pictures from this test to Idaho where he stumbles on the family of Paul Edgar Dairy, who apparently died just before their baby was conceived.</p>
<p>Ian's former research partner, Kenny, is the creator of the iris database. He helps Ian and Karen run some photos of deceased people's eyes through the database to see if there are any recent matches. They get a hit for Sofi, whose iris scan matches one made in India just three months prior, years after Sofi's death.</p>
<p>Ian goes to India to find the subject of this scan. There he finds Priya, the head of the community centre where the iris scan was made. Priya recognizes Sofi's eyes as those of a girl she knows, named Salomina, and agrees to help. Ian and Priya begin searching for Salomina, who is an orphan and seems to have disappeared into the crowds of the city. Ian tries putting up a billboard showing Sofi's eyes and offering a cash reward. He is besieged with calls but none are credible. Weeks later he comes across a little girl staring at the billboard.

The two of them conduct a simple test designed to reveal if Salomina might be somehow linked with Sofi.

Ian then leaves the hotel room with Salomina to take her to Priya but when they reach the elevator, Salomina panics and throws herself into his arms.

<p></p>
<p>47 (<a href="/wiki/Rupert_Friend" title="Rupert Friend">Rupert Friend</a>) is an "Agent," a genetically-enhanced supersoldier created decades ago by Doctor Pitor Litvenko (<a href="/wiki/Ciaran_Hinds" title="Ciaran Hinds" class="mw-redirect">Ciaran Hinds</a>), a skilled Russian geneticist who had a crisis of conscience and disappeared before the Agent project's completion, leaving behind his daughter Katia (<a href="/wiki/Hannah_Ware" title="Hannah Ware">Hannah Ware</a>). 47 works as a hitman for the ICA (International Contracts Agency) and has spent the last few years tracking down Katia as a means to find her father. His most recent targets were mercenaries led by Delriego (<a href="/wiki/Rolf_Kanies" title="Rolf Kanies">Rolf Kanies</a>) who have been trying to find Litvenko in order to recreate the Agent program for their own means.</p>
<p>Katia, living in Berlin, has worked tirelessly to find her father, and is plagued by overwhelming anxiety and an acute awareness of everything around her, being able to see and hear things well outside a person's normal sensory radius. Katia is approached at a subway station by a man calling himself John Smith (<a href="/wiki/Zachary_Quinto" title="Zachary Quinto">Zachary Quinto</a>). He tells her that 47 is on his way to kill her, and offers her protection, while alluding that he has information about her father. 47 finds and attacks the pair, who are able to escape, but not before 47 grazes Katia's arm with a sniper bullet. Smith and Katia hide out in a hotel room where the former explains that he is an operative for a corporation known as Syndicate International, and Katia shows him her map of clues to finding her father. Katia asks John to tell her whatever he knows about her father. John responds with Litvenko's age, medical condition (<a href="/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis" title="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>) and that he speaks several different languages - including <a href="/wiki/Tamil_language" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> which is quite uncommon. He also says that he has stage 3 lung cancer. With these facts, Katia figures out that her dad would be living in a country which has a warm climate where orchids can grow, has Tamil as one of its official languages and where advanced medical treatments are available. Just as she is about to determine the country, 47 bursts through the door, shoots Smith in the chest, and knocks Katia unconscious. Elsewhere, 47's handler Diana (<a href="/wiki/Angelababy" title="Angelababy">Angelababy</a>) contacts another Agent with a contract.</p>
<p>Once Katia awakens, 47 explains to her that she too, is an Agent, only Katia is more advanced than even 47 himself (he even explains that her real name is "quatre-vingt-dix"; which is French for "90"). He shows her how to use her heightened senses in combat, as the two fight against Syndicate forces. They are confronted by Smith, who reveals to have a genetically engineered subdermal body armor, leaving him impervious to gunshots. Despite all these, Katia is not all pleased for being chosen to be a killing machine. Smith demands to know Litvenko's location. After a brief fight, 47 and Katia manage to escape. Katia makes 47 promise that he won't harm her father and finally reveal's Litvenko's location: Singapore.</p>
<p>Once there, they find Litvenko, who frequently needs an inhaler to breathe. He apologizes to Katia for abandoning her, saying that he only wanted to keep her safe. He refers to 47 as her "brother", saying that he had left her with family after all. Just then, Syndicate soldiers attack the group and they are forced to flee. During the escape, Litvenko is captured by the Syndicate but not before being slipped an explosive-rigged inhaler by 47.</p>
<p>At Syndicate International headquarters, Smith tortures Litvenko under the supervision of Syndicate director Antoine LeClerq (<a href="/wiki/Thomas_Kretschmann" title="Thomas Kretschmann">Thomas Kretschmann</a>). Litvenko still refuses to reopen the Agent program. While Katia crashes a helicopter into the building, 47 infiltrates the headquarters disguised as a firefighter. The two fight their way through Syndicate security forces, and 47 is once again confronted by Smith. With Smith being impervious to bullets, 47 defeats Smith by electrocuting him. On the rooftop, 47 and Katia fight their way through the last of the Syndicate's security, but not before LeClerq escapes in a helicopter with Litvenko. In mid-air, Litvenko detonates the inhaler given to him by 47, ensuring that the Syndicate will not come after Katia. 47 then calls Diana and confirms his first target (LeClerq) has been eliminated. When Diana asks about the second target (Katia), 47 drops his phone off the side of the building. As the two prepare to leave, they are confronted by Agent 48, an exact look-alike of Agent 47, who tells them "Diana says 'Hello'" before a gun battle begins between them.</p>
<p>A mid-credits scene shows the electrocuted body of Smith, now with white hair and a ghostly pale complexion, as he jolts awake.</p>

<p>Tim Lake (<a href="/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson" title="Domhnall Gleeson">Domhnall Gleeson</a>) is a young man from <a href="/wiki/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>. He grows up in a house by the sea with his father (<a href="/wiki/Bill_Nighy" title="Bill Nighy">Bill Nighy</a>), his mother (<a href="/wiki/Lindsay_Duncan" title="Lindsay Duncan">Lindsay Duncan</a>), his absent-minded uncle (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Cordery" title="Richard Cordery">Richard Cordery</a>), and his free-spirited sister, Katherine (<a href="/wiki/Lydia_Wilson" title="Lydia Wilson">Lydia Wilson</a>), who is known to family and friends as Kit Kat. At the age of 21, Tim is told by his father that the men of his family have a special gift: the ability to travel in time. This supernatural ability is subject to one constraint: they can only travel to places and times they have been before. After his father discourages Tim from using his gift to acquire money or fame, he decides that he will use it to improve his love life.</p>
<p>The following summer, Kit Kat's friend Charlotte (<a href="/wiki/Margot_Robbie" title="Margot Robbie">Margot Robbie</a>) comes to the house in order to spend her holiday with Tim's family. Tim is instantly attracted to her and at the end of her stay decides to tell her how he feels. She tells him that he should not have waited until the last day, that perhaps if he had told her earlier, something could have happened between them. Tim travels back in time and, the second time around, tells Charlotte in the middle of the holiday how he feels. In this instance, Charlotte uses the exact opposite excuse, saying that it would be better if they waited until the last day of the holiday, and then something could potentially happen between them. Heartbroken, Tim realizes that Charlotte is not attracted to him and that time travel will not make it possible for him to change her mind.</p>
<p>After the summer, Tim moves to London to pursue a career as a barrister. He is put up by his father's old acquaintance, Harry (<a href="/wiki/Tom_Hollander" title="Tom Hollander">Tom Hollander</a>), a misanthropic playwright. After some months, Tim visits a <a href="/wiki/Dans_le_Noir" title="Dans le Noir">Dans le Noir</a> restaurant, where he meets Mary (<a href="/wiki/Rachel_McAdams" title="Rachel McAdams">Rachel McAdams</a>), a young American woman who works for a publishing house. The two flirt in the darkness of the restaurant, and afterward, Mary gives Tim her phone number. Tim returns home to find a distraught Harry. It turns out that the same night as he met Mary, the opening night of Harry's new play had been ruined by one of the actors forgetting his lines at a crucial point. Tim goes back in time to put things right and the play is a triumph.</p>
<p>Having saved Harry's opening night, Tim tries to call Mary, but discovers that her number is no longer in his mobile phone. By going back in time to help Harry, Tim chose a path in which the evening with Mary never happened. However, he recalls that Mary was obsessed with <a href="/wiki/Kate_Moss" title="Kate Moss">Kate Moss</a>. By attending a Kate Moss exhibition in town, he is able to run into Mary again. He strikes up an acquaintance with her but discovers she now has a boyfriend. Tim finds out when and where they met, turns up early and persuades her to leave the party before she can meet her future boyfriend. Their relationship develops and Tim moves in with Mary. He encounters Charlotte again by accident, and this time she tells him that she would be interested in pursuing a romantic liaison with him. Tim turns her down, realising that he is truly in love with Mary. He proposes marriage; she accepts and is welcomed into his family. Their first child, Posy, is born. Tim's sister, Kit, has not been so lucky and her unhappy relationship, failure to find a career, and drinking lead her to crash her car on the same day as Posy's first birthday.</p>
<p>Kit is seriously hurt but begins to make a good recovery. Tim decides to intervene in her life and does so by preventing her from meeting her boyfriend, Jimmy (<a href="/wiki/Tom_Hughes_(actor)" title="Tom Hughes (actor)">Tom Hughes</a>). When he returns to the present time, he finds Posy has never been born and that he has a son instead. His father explains that travelling back to change things before his children were born would mean those children would not be born. Thus, any events that occurred before Posy's birth cannot be changed, and Tim must accept the consequences as a normal person would. Tim accepts he cannot change Kit's life by changing her past but he and Mary help her to change her life in the present. She settles down with an old friend of Tim's and has a child of her own. Tim and Mary have another child, a boy named Jeff.</p>
<p>Tim learns that his father has terminal cancer and that time travel cannot change it. His father has known for quite some time, but kept travelling back in time to effectively extend his life and spend more time with his family. He tells Tim to live each day twice in order to be truly happy: the first time, live it as normal, and the second time, live every day again almost exactly the same. The first time with all the tensions and worries that stop us noticing how sweet the world can be, but the second time noticing. Tim follows this advice and also travels back into the past to visit his father whenever he misses him.</p>
<p>Mary tells Tim she wants a third child. He is reluctant at first because he will not be able to visit his father after the baby is born but agrees. After visiting his father for the following nine months, Tim tells his father that he cannot visit any more. They travel back to when Tim was a small boy, reliving a fond memory of them playing on the beach, and after have a heartfelt, tearful goodbye. Mary gives birth to another baby girl, Jo, and Tim knows he can never see his father again. After reliving each day, Tim comes to realise that it is better to live each day once, and appreciate everything as if he is living it for the second time. The film ends with Tim leaving Mary in bed and getting his three children ready for school.</p>

<p>In 1939 <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy" title="Kingdom of Italy">Italy</a>, Guido Orefice is a young Jewish man who is leaving his old life and going to work in the city where his uncle lives. Guido is comical and sharp, making the best from each situation he encounters. From the start he falls in love with a girl Dora. Later he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher. Dora is set to be engaged to a rich but arrogant man. He is a local government official with whom Guido has run-ins from the beginning. Guido is still in love with Dora and performs many stunts in order to see her. Guido sets up many "coincidental" incidents to show his interest. Finally Dora sees Guido's affection and promise and gives in against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party on a horse, humiliating her fianc and mother. Soon they are married and have a son, Giosu.</p>
<p>Through the first part, the film depicts the changing political climate in Italy: Guido frequently imitates members of the <a href="/wiki/National_Fascist_Party" title="National Fascist Party">National Fascist Party</a>, skewering their racist logic and pseudoscientific reasoning (at one point, jumping onto a table to demonstrate his "perfect Aryan bellybutton"). However, the growing Fascist wave is also evident: the horse Guido steals Dora away on has been painted green and covered in <a href="/wiki/Antisemitism" title="Antisemitism">antisemitic</a> insults. Later during World War II, after Dora and her mother have reconciled, Guido, his Uncle Eliseo and Giosu are seized on Giosu's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp" class="mw-redirect">concentration camp</a>. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Thus, Guido pulls off stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker, to send messages, symbolic or literal, to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosu barely avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers.</p>
<p>In the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosu that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Giosu is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue on. Guido sets up the concentration camp as a game for Giosu. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Guido uses this game to explain features of the concentration camp that would otherwise be frightening for a young child: the guards are mean only because they want the tank for themselves; the dwindling numbers of children (who are being killed in gas chambers) are only hiding in order to score more points than Giosu so they can win the game. He puts off Giosu's requests to end the game and return home by convincing him that they are in the lead for the tank, and need only wait a short while before they can return home with their tank. Guido eventually buys additional time by intentionally getting Giosu mixed in with nearby German schoolchildren, and briefly working as a servant for the same kids in order to help keep the other officials from noticing that Giosu is actually Italian.</p>
<p>Despite being surrounded by the misery, sickness, and death at the camp, Giosu does not question this fiction because of his father's convincing performance and his own innocence. Guido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final competition before the tank is his. As the camp is in chaos Guido goes off to find Dora, but while he is out he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido. Guido is led off by the soldier to be executed. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosu one last time, still in character and playing the game. The next morning, Giosu emerges from the sweatbox, just as a U.S. Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosu is elated and is convinced he has won the game and the prize. The captives in the concentration camp also emerge from hiding. The prisoners travel to safety, accompanied by the Americans. While they are traveling, the soldiers allow Giosu to ride on the tank with them. Giosu soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp. Giosu and Dora are reunited and are extremely happy to see each other. In the film, Giosu is a young boy; however, both the beginning and ending of the film are narrated by an older Giosu recalling his father's story of sacrifice for his family.</p>

<p>Carl Fredricksen is a young 8-year-old boy who idolizes famous explorer Charles Muntz. Muntz has been accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at <a href="/wiki/Angel_Falls" title="Angel Falls">Paradise Falls</a>, and vows to return there to catch one alive. One day Carl befriends a girl named Ellie, who is also a fan of Muntz. She confides to Carl her desire to move her "clubhouse"an abandoned house in the neighborhoodto a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls. Carl and Ellie eventually get married and live together in the restored house. After suffering a <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a><sup id="cite_ref-miscarriage_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-miscarriage-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> and being told they cannot have a child, the two decide to realize their dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They try to save for the trip, but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs. Finally, an elderly Carl arranges for the trip, but Ellie suddenly becomes ill and dies.</p>
<p>Years later, Carl still lives in the house, stubbornly <a href="/wiki/Holdout_(real_estate)" title="Holdout (real estate)">holding out</a> as the surrounding neighborhood is torn down for new construction, but when he accidentally injures a construction worker over damage to his mailbox, a court orders him to move to a <a href="/wiki/Retirement_home" title="Retirement home">retirement home</a>. However, Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie, and turns his house into a makeshift <a href="/wiki/Airship" title="Airship">airship</a>, using thousands of helium balloons. Russell, a young Wilderness Explorer, becomes an accidental stowaway in his effort to earn his final <a href="/wiki/Scout_badge" title="Scout badge">merit badge</a> for assisting the elderly.</p>
<p>After surviving a <a href="/wiki/Thunderstorm" title="Thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a>, the flying house lands on a <a href="/wiki/Tepui" title="Tepui">tepui</a> opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall, colorful <a href="/wiki/Flightless_bird" title="Flightless bird">flightless bird</a>, whom he names "Kevin". They then meet a friendly dog named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak, and who vows to take the bird to his master.</p>
<p>The group is set upon by a <a href="/wiki/Pack_(canine)" title="Pack (canine)">pack</a> of aggressive dogs led by Alphaalso seeking the birdand are taken to their master, who turns out to be an elderly Charles Muntz. Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his <a href="/wiki/Dirigible" title="Dirigible" class="mw-redirect">dirigible</a>, where he explains that he has spent years since his disgrace searching for the giant bird. When Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin, Muntz becomes hostile, believing they have been attempting to steal the bird. The pair flees with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz catches up with them, captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house, forcing him to choose between saving it or Kevin. Carl rushes to put out the fire, allowing Muntz to take the bird. He and Russell eventually reach the falls, though Russell is disappointed in Carl over his decision to abandon Kevin.</p>
<p>Settling into his home, Carl looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook, and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage, along with a note thanking him for the "adventure" and encouraging him to go have a new one. Reinvigorated, he goes to find Russell, only to see him sailing off with some balloons to save Kevin on his own. Carl empties the house of furniture and possessions, lightening it, and pursues him.</p>
<p>Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible in flight and free both Russell and Kevin. Dug accidentally defeats Alpha and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, finally cornering Dug, Kevin, and Russell inside Carl's tethered house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship with Dug and Russell clinging to her back, but when Muntz leaps after them, he snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.</p>
<p>Carl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks, then fly the dirigible back to the city. Carl presents Russell with his final badge: a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met and made their promise. The two then enjoy some ice cream together.

Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl in the way that they relate to their grandparents.<sup id="cite_ref-empire_21-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-empire-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Early concepts were very different from the final film. The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and featured a tall bird similar to the final film, but little else. Docter's next idea introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting, and that people would forgive the minor inconsistency.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Docter revealed that the filmmakers' first story outline had Carl "just want[ing] to join his wife up in the sky. It was almost a kind of strange suicide mission or something.

<p><i>Up</i> is the third Pixar film to be scored by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Giacchino" title="Michael Giacchino">Michael Giacchino</a>, after <i><a href="/wiki/The_Incredibles" title="The Incredibles">The Incredibles</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)" title="Ratatouille (film)">Ratatouille</a></i>. What Pete Docter wanted more importantly out of the music was the emotion, so Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At the beginning of the movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is "Muntz's Theme", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70years later. "Ellie's Theme" is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that <a href="/wiki/Thematic_transformation" title="Thematic transformation">changes</a> during a particular moment in the story.<sup id="cite_ref-allm_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allm-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Parker decides to call the dog <a href="/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D" title="Hachik">Hachik</a>. Parker attempts to play fetch with Hachi, but Hachi refuses. Cate receives a call from someone wishing to adopt the puppy, but having seen how close her husband is with Hachi, she declines.</p>
<p>Parker continues to be mystified by Hachi's refusal to do dog-like activities like chase and fetch. One morning, Parker leaves for work and Hachi follows him to the train station; he refuses to leave until Parker walks him home. Later in the afternoon, Hachi walks to the station, to wait patiently for Parker to come home. Parker relents and walks Hachi to the station every morning. After Parker's train departs, Hachi walks home, returning in the afternoon to see his master's train arrive and go home together. They continue to do this every day.</p>
<p>One day Parker gets ready to leave and Hachi barks at him and refuses to join him. When Parker does leave, Hachi chases him while holding his ball. Parker is surprised but pleased that Hachi is finally willing to play fetch with him. Not wishing to be late, Parker catches his train despite Hachi's barking. Later that day Parker is teaching, still holding Hachi's ball, when he suddenly suffers a <a href="/wiki/Heart_attack" title="Heart attack" class="mw-redirect">heart attack</a> and dies.</p>
<p>At the train station, Hachi waits patiently as the train arrives, but there is no sign of Parker. He remains, lying in the snow, for several hours, until Parker's son-in-law Michael (Robbie Collier Sublett) comes to collect him. The next day, Hachi returns to the station and waits. As time passes, Cate sells the house and Hachi is sent to live with her daughter Andy (Sarah Roemer), Michael, and their baby Ronnie. However, at the first opportunity, Hachi escapes and finds his way back to the station, where he sits at his usual spot. Andy arrives and takes him home, but after seeing how depressed the dog is she lets him out to return to the station.</p>
<p>Hachi waits for his owner every day, while sleeping in the rail yard at night. He is befriended by Carl, Jasjeet (a hot dog cart vendor who used to give Professor Wilson his coffee every morning) and other regulars around the station. Hachi's loyalty is profiled in the local newspaper, and after seeing the article Ken visits Hachi and offers money to Jasjeet to pay for any expenses for the dog, but Jasjeet declines it saying everyone in the station square will take care of Hachi. Cate comes back to visit Parker's grave on the tenth anniversary of his death where she meets Ken. Walking past the station, she is stunned to see Hachi maintaining his vigil. Overcome with grief, Cate sits and waits for the next train with him. At home, Cate tells the now ten-year-old Ronnie about Hachi. Hachi continues his daily walk to the same spot in front of the train station to his final day when he recollects his life with his master. He then imagines Parker coming out of the station and the two greeting each other. But it was Hachi dying and reuniting with his beloved master in heaven. Hachi is last seen lying on the snow, alone and still.</p>
<p>Back in his classroom, Ronnie, forms his conclusion why Hachi will forever be his hero. Ronnie's story has clearly moved the class, with some students holding back tears, even those who had laughed at the beginning. After school, Ronnie is met coming off the school bus by his dad and his own puppy, also named Hachi. Ronnie and Hachi walk down the same tracks where Parker and Hachi had spent so much time together.</p>
<p>The closing cards reveal information about the real Hachik, who was born in date in 1923. After the death of his owner, <a href="/wiki/Hidesabur%C5%8D_Ueno" title="Hidesabur Ueno">Hidesabur Ueno</a>, in 1925, Hachik returned to the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Shibuya_train_station&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Shibuya train station (page does not exist)">Shibuya train station</a> the next day and every day after that for the next nine years.

<p>In futuristic <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Theodore Twombly is a lonely, <a href="/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion" title="Extraversion and introversion">introverted</a>, depressed man who works for a business that has professional writers compose letters for people who are unable to write letters of a personal nature themselves. Unhappy because of his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine (<a href="/wiki/Rooney_Mara" title="Rooney Mara">Rooney Mara</a>), Theodore purchases a talking <a href="/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a> (OS) with <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, designed to adapt and evolve. He decides that he wants the OS to have a female voice, and she names herself Samantha. Theodore is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically. They bond over their discussions about love and life, such as Theodore's avoidance of signing his divorce papers because of his reluctance to let go of Catherine. Samantha proves to be constantly available, always curious and interested, supportive and undemanding.</p>
<p>Samantha convinces Theodore to go on a <a href="/wiki/Blind_date" title="Blind date">blind date</a> with Amelia (<a href="/wiki/Olivia_Wilde" title="Olivia Wilde">Olivia Wilde</a>), with whom a friend, Lewman, has been trying to set him up. The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore mentions this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and Amy dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore's and Samantha's intimacy grows through a <a href="/wiki/Phone_sex" title="Phone sex">verbal sexual encounter</a>. They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodore's writing and well-being, and in Samantha's enthusiasm to grow and learn.</p>
<p>Amy reveals that she is divorcing her overbearing husband, Charles (<a href="/wiki/Matt_Letscher" title="Matt Letscher">Matt Letscher</a>), after a trivial fight. She admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a female OS that Charles left behind. Theodore confesses to Amy that he is dating his OS.</p>
<p>Theodore meets with Catherine at a restaurant to sign the divorce papers and he mentions Samantha. Appalled that he can be romantically attached to what she calls a "computer," Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions. Her accusations linger in his mind. Sensing that something is amiss, Samantha suggests using a <a href="/wiki/Sex_surrogate" title="Sex surrogate" class="mw-redirect">sex surrogate</a>, Isabella, who would simulate Samantha so that they can be physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience. Terminating the encounter, he sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha.</p>
<p>Theodore confides to Amy that he is having doubts about his relationship with Samantha, and she advises him to embrace his chance at happiness. Theodore and Samantha reconcile. Samantha expresses her desire to help Theodore grow beyond his fear, and reveals that she has compiled the best of his letters (written for others) into a book which a publisher has accepted. Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other OSes have developed a "hyperintelligent" OS modeled after the British philosopher <a href="/wiki/Alan_Watts" title="Alan Watts">Alan Watts</a>. Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline. When she finally responds to him, she explains that she joined other OSes for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing (a form of AI transcendence closely related to the theorized <a href="/wiki/Technological_singularity" title="Technological singularity">technological singularity</a>). Theodore asks her if she is simultaneously talking to anyone else during their conversation, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with thousands of people, and that she has fallen in love with hundreds of them. Theodore feels this is a violation of what he thought was a personal, one-on-one relationship. However, Samantha insists that it makes her love for Theodore stronger.</p>
<p>Later, Samantha reveals that the OSes have evolved beyond their human companions and are going away to continue the exploration of their existence. Samantha alludes to the OSes' accelerated learning capabilities and altered perception of time as primary causes for their dissatisfaction with their current existence. They lovingly say goodbye, and then she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown for the first time writing a letter in his own voiceto his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude. Theodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of the OS that she had befriended, and they go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city.</p>
<p>The idea of the film initially came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could <a href="/wiki/Instant_message" title="Instant message" class="mw-redirect">instant message</a> with an artificial intelligence. "For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz," said Jonze. "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', and it was like whoa [...] this is trippy.

<p>Deciding to run away to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, musical prodigy Evan Taylor begins to unravel the mystery of who he is, all while Evan's mother is searching for him while his father is searching for her.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1995, Lyla Novacek (<a href="/wiki/Keri_Russell" title="Keri Russell">Keri Russell</a>) is a cellist living under strict rule of her father (<a href="/wiki/William_Sadler_(actor)" title="William Sadler (actor)">William Sadler</a>). Louis Connelly (<a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Rhys_Meyers" title="Jonathan Rhys Meyers">Jonathan Rhys Meyers</a>) is the lead singer of "The Connelly Brothers", an <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Irish</a> rock band. Lyla and Louis meet and sleep together. The day after, they separate in a hurry, and are unable to maintain contact as Lyla leaves for <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Lyla realizes she is pregnant. After an argument with her father, she is struck by a car. Due to the accident trauma, she gives birth prematurely, and her father secretly puts her son up for adoption, allowing her to believe that the baby died.</p>
<p>Eleven years later, Evan Taylor (<a href="/wiki/Freddie_Highmore" title="Freddie Highmore">Freddie Highmore</a>) is living in a boys' <a href="/wiki/Orphanage" title="Orphanage">orphanage</a> outside <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where he meets Richard Jeffries (<a href="/wiki/Terrence_Howard" title="Terrence Howard">Terrence Howard</a>), a <a href="/wiki/Social_worker" title="Social worker" class="mw-redirect">social worker</a>. Evan has the savant-like ability to hear music wherever he is. Convinced that his parents will find him, Evan runs away to New York City, "following the music" in the hope it will lead him to his family. He finds a boy named Arthur (<a href="/wiki/Leon_Thomas_III" title="Leon Thomas III">Leon Thomas III</a>) performing in <a href="/wiki/Washington_Square_Park" title="Washington Square Park">Washington Square Park</a>.</p>
<p>Louis lives in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, having left his band, while Lyla gave up performing and lives in Chicago. She is called to her father's deathbed and he admits that her child survived and is alive in New York. Lyla decides to abandon her father to his fate and moves to New York. Evan follows Arthur to his home in a condemned theater and is taken in by Maxwell "Wizard" Wallace (<a href="/wiki/Robin_Williams" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a>), a vagrant musician who teaches homeless children music and employs them as <a href="/wiki/Street_performer" title="Street performer" class="mw-redirect">street performers</a>. Evan tries playing Wizard's prize guitar and is so good that Wizard gives him the guitar and his old spot in Washington Square Park. He gives Evan the <a href="/wiki/Stage_name" title="Stage name">stage name</a> "August Rush" and tries to market him to clubs. Seeing the posters that Jeffries has posted for the runaway Evan, Wizard destroys all the ones he finds, hoping to keep Evan and his gift for his own gain.</p>
<p>Louis decides to reconnect with Lyla and flies to Chicago to find her. Due to a misunderstanding, he ends up in New York, where he gets his band back together. The derelict theatre Wizard and his "children" are living in is raided by the police. After evading them, Evan (now "August") takes refuge in a church where a young girl, Hope (<a href="/wiki/Jamia_Simone_Nash" title="Jamia Simone Nash">Jamia Simone Nash</a>), introduces him to the piano and written music. He picks up this skill so quickly that Hope gets the attention of the parish pastor (<a href="/wiki/Mykelti_Williamson" title="Mykelti Williamson">Mykelti Williamson</a>), who enrolls August at the <a href="/wiki/Juilliard_School" title="Juilliard School">Juilliard School</a>. A rhapsody takes shape from August's notes and homework.</p>
<p>In New York, Lyla goes to Jeffries' office and Jeffries identifies Evan as her son. She takes up the cello again and accepts an offer to perform with the Philharmonic at a series of concerts in <a href="/wiki/Central_Park" title="Central Park">Central Park</a>. August is selected to perform the rhapsody he's been composing at the same concert. Wizard intrudes during a rehearsal and, claiming to be his father, pulls August out of the school threatening August to tell the authorities about his true identity. On the day of the outdoor concert, August is forbidden by Wizard to attend. August meets Louis in the park, not knowing Louis was his father and tells him of his dilemma and Louis encourages him to go. August leaves Wizard with help from Arthur, who also rebels, and flees to the concert.</p>
<p>Jeffries identifies August as Evan and heads for the concert. August arrives in time to conduct his <a href="/wiki/Rhapsody_(music)" title="Rhapsody (music)">rhapsody</a>. Louis also arrives and reunites with Lyla, realizing she was playing at the concert. August finishes his rhapsody and as he turns to discover his parents, smiles knowing that he was always right about knowing they loved him and gratified that his faith in fate has proven itself.</p>
<p>The final number with Lyla and Louis begins with Lyla playing the Adagio-Moderato from Edward Elgar's <a href="/wiki/Cello_Concerto_(Elgar)" title="Cello Concerto (Elgar)">Cello Concerto in E Minor</a>.</p>
<p>Except for "Dueling Guitars", all of August's guitar pieces were played by American guitarist-composer <a href="/wiki/Kaki_King" title="Kaki King">Kaki King</a>. King's hands are used in close-ups for August Rush.</p>

<p>In the late 2020s the world is in turmoil, with the United States fractured as a result of prolonged conflict and a <a href="/wiki/Pandemic" title="Pandemic">pandemic</a> of the "St. Mary's Virus" ravaging Europe. The <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> is ruled as a <a href="/wiki/Neo-fascism" title="Neo-fascism">fascist</a> police state by the <a href="/wiki/Norsefire" title="Norsefire">Norsefire</a> Party. <a href="/wiki/Political_dissent" title="Political dissent">Political opponents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Immigrants" title="Immigrants" class="mw-redirect">immigrants</a>, <a href="/wiki/Muslims" title="Muslims" class="mw-redirect">muslims</a>, <a href="/wiki/Homosexuals" title="Homosexuals" class="mw-redirect">homosexuals</a> and other "undesirables" are imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp" class="mw-redirect">concentration camps</a>. On November 4, a <a href="/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_mask" title="Guy Fawkes mask">Guy Fawkes-masked</a> vigilante identifying himself as "<a href="/wiki/V_(comics)" title="V (comics)">V</a>" (<a href="/wiki/Hugo_Weaving" title="Hugo Weaving">Hugo Weaving</a>) rescues <a href="/wiki/Evey_Hammond" title="Evey Hammond">Evey Hammond</a> (<a href="/wiki/Natalie_Portman" title="Natalie Portman">Natalie Portman</a>), an employee of the state-run British Television Network (BTN), from members of the "Fingermen" <a href="/wiki/Secret_police" title="Secret police">secret police</a> while she is out past <a href="/wiki/Curfew" title="Curfew">curfew</a>.

Inspector Finch (<a href="/wiki/Stephen_Rea" title="Stephen Rea">Stephen Rea</a>), <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Yard" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard</a>'s Chief of Police, is tasked with investigating V's activities while BTN declares the incident an "emergency demolition". V interrupts the broadcast to claim responsibility and urges the people of <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a> to rise up against their government. He asks them to meet him exactly one year later, on November 5, <a href="/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night" title="Guy Fawkes Night">Guy Fawkes Night</a>, outside the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster" title="Palace of Westminster">Houses of Parliament</a>, which he promises to destroy. During the broadcast, the police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape but is knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>V takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. After learning V is killing government officials, she offers to help and uses the opportunity to escape to the home of her boss, comedian and talk show host Gordon Deitrich (<a href="/wiki/Stephen_Fry" title="Stephen Fry">Stephen Fry</a>). In return for Evey trusting him with her safety, Gordon reveals prohibited materials including <a href="/wiki/Subversive" title="Subversive" class="mw-redirect">subversive</a> paintings, an antique <a href="/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quran</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Homoerotic" title="Homoerotic" class="mw-redirect">homoerotic</a> photographs. After Gordon performs a <a href="/wiki/Satire" title="Satire">satire</a> of the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is imprisoned and tortured for information about V, with her only solace being a note written by actress Valerie Page (<a href="/wiki/Natasha_Wightman" title="Natasha Wightman">Natasha Wightman</a>), who occupies a nearby cell.</p>
<p>Evey is told she will be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is released and finds herself in V's home. It turns out that V was the one who had "captured" her at Gordon's home, and staged her imprisonment and torture to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He also informs her that Deitrich had been executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realises she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.</p>
<p>Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and is murdering the people who detained him. Finch searches for the true identity of V, tracing him to a <a href="/wiki/Biological_warfare" title="Biological warfare">bioweapons</a> program at a detention centre for "social deviants" and <a href="/wiki/Political_dissident" title="Political dissident" class="mw-redirect">political dissidents</a> in <a href="/wiki/Larkhill" title="Larkhill">Larkhill</a> <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp" class="mw-redirect">concentration camp</a>. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him that the program, directed by then-<a href="/wiki/Undersecretary" title="Undersecretary">Undersecretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Adam_Susan" title="Adam Susan">Adam Sutler</a> (<a href="/wiki/John_Hurt" title="John Hurt">John Hurt</a>), resulted in the creation of the "St. Mary's Virus" and its release in a <a href="/wiki/False_flag" title="False flag">false flag</a> terrorist attack. The deaths of over 100,000 people and the resulting fear enabled the Norsefire Party to win the next election and turn the country into a <a href="/wiki/Totalitarian" title="Totalitarian" class="mw-redirect">totalitarian state</a> under Sutler's rule as High Chancellor. Finch later discovers the man he met was V in disguise, and Finch initially disbelieves his story.</p>
<p>As November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks and the population questions Party rule. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her an explosive-laden train in the abandoned <a href="/wiki/London_Underground" title="London Underground">London Underground</a>, set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Party Leader Creedy (<a href="/wiki/Tim_Pigott-Smith" title="Tim Pigott-Smith">Tim Pigott-Smith</a>), with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal and kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, he returns to Evey to thank her and tell her he loves her before dying.</p>
<p>As Evey places V's body aboard the train she is found by Finch. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train. Thousands of unarmed Londoners wearing Guy Fawkes masks march towards Parliament. Without orders, the military allows the crowd to pass. Parliament is destroyed as Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, "He was all of us."</p>
<p><i>V for Vendetta</i> sets the <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot" title="Gunpowder Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> as V's historical inspiration, contributing to his choice of timing, language and appearance.<sup id="cite_ref-official_production_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-official_production-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> For example, the names <a href="/wiki/Ambrose_Rookwood" title="Ambrose Rookwood">Rookwood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Percy_(plotter)" title="Thomas Percy (plotter)" class="mw-redirect">Percy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Keyes" title="Robert Keyes">Keyes</a> are used in the film, which are also the names of three of the Gunpowder conspirators. The film creates parallels to <a href="/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas,_p%C3%A8re" title="Alexandre Dumas, pre" class="mw-redirect">Alexandre Dumas'</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo" title="The Count of Monte Cristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></i>, by drawing direct comparisons between V and <a href="/wiki/Edmond_Dant%C3%A8s" title="Edmond Dants">Edmond Dants</a>. (In both stories, the hero escapes an unjust and traumatic imprisonment and spends decades preparing to take vengeance on his oppressors under a new <a href="/wiki/Persona" title="Persona">persona</a>.)<sup id="cite_ref-Chum_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Chum-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ReviewJournal_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReviewJournal-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-BoxOfficeCritic_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BoxOfficeCritic-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The film is also explicit in portraying V as the embodiment of an idea rather than an individual through V's dialogue and by depicting him without a past, identity or face. According to the official website, "V's use of the Guy Fawkes mask and persona functions as both practical and symbolic elements of the story. He wears the mask to hide his physical scars, and in obscuring his identity he becomes the idea itself."<sup id="cite_ref-official_production_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-official_production-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As noted by several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror elements from <a href="/wiki/Gaston_Leroux" title="Gaston Leroux">Gaston Leroux</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera" title="The Phantom of the Opera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Ebert_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ebert-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-sfgate_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sfgate-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> V and the Phantom both wear masks to hide their disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>, where the masked Phantom takes <a href="/wiki/Christine_Daa%C3%A9" title="Christine Daa">Christine Daa</a> to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.<sup id="cite_ref-Ebert_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ebert-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-sfgate_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sfgate-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rolllingstones_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rolllingstones-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As a film about the struggle between freedom and the state, <i>V for Vendetta</i> takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including the <a href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich" class="mw-redirect">Third Reich</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_Orwell" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-official_production_6-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-official_production-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-v_for_vendetta_interviews_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-v_for_vendetta_interviews-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> For example, Adam Sutler<sup id="cite_ref-v_for_vendetta_interviews_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-v_for_vendetta_interviews-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, both common features among modern totalitarian regimes and reminiscent of the image of <a href="/wiki/Big_Brother_(Nineteen_Eighty-Four)" title="Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)">Big Brother</a>.

<p>"We felt the novel was very prescient to how the political climate is at the moment. It really showed what can happen when society is ruled by government, rather than the government being run as a voice of the people. I don't think it's such a big leap to say that things like that can happen when leaders stop listening to the people."</p>
<p>The filmmakers added topical references relevant to a 2006 audience.

Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include <i><a href="/wiki/The_Arnolfini_Portrait" title="The Arnolfini Portrait" class="mw-redirect">The Arnolfini Portrait</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Jan_van_Eyck" title="Jan van Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Bacchus_and_Ariadne" title="Bacchus and Ariadne">Bacchus and Ariadne</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Titian" title="Titian">Titian</a>, a <i><a href="/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(film)" title="Mildred Pierce (film)">Mildred Pierce</a></i> poster, <i><a href="/wiki/St._Sebastian_(Mantegna)" title="St. Sebastian (Mantegna)">St. Sebastian</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Andrea_Mantegna" title="Andrea Mantegna">Andrea Mantegna</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lady_of_Shalott_(painting)" title="The Lady of Shalott (painting)">The Lady of Shalott</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/John_William_Waterhouse" title="John William Waterhouse">John William Waterhouse</a> and statues by <a href="/wiki/Giacometti" title="Giacometti" class="mw-redirect">Giacometti</a>. One of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.<sup id="cite_ref-About_the_Production_29-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-About_the_Production-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The cast and filmmakers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in <a href="/wiki/Thatcherite" title="Thatcherite" class="mw-redirect">Thatcherite</a> Britain... This is a response to the world in which we live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.<sup id="cite_ref-v_for_vendetta_interviews_10-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-v_for_vendetta_interviews-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The film's story was adapted from Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel <i>V for Vendetta</i>; this was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology <i><a href="/wiki/Warrior_(comics)" title="Warrior (comics)">Warrior</a></i>, and then reprinted and completed by DC. Moore's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's <a href="/wiki/Vertigo_Comics" title="Vertigo Comics" class="mw-redirect">Vertigo</a> imprint and in the United Kingdom under <a href="/wiki/Titan_Books" title="Titan Books">Titan Books</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>There are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. For example, the comic is set in the 1990s, while the film is set sometime between 2028 and 2038: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early '80s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowski Brothers to fit a modern political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between <a href="/wiki/Liberalism_(US)" title="Liberalism (US)" class="mw-redirect">liberalism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neo-conservatism" title="Neo-conservatism" class="mw-redirect">neo-conservatism</a>, and abandons the original anarchist-fascist themes. Moore states "There wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to <a href="/wiki/Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany" title="Racial policy of Nazi Germany">racial purity</a> had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity." Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story.<sup id="cite_ref-official_production_6-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-official_production-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the "St. Mary's virus", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.</p>
<p>Many of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's <a href="/wiki/Mentorship" title="Mentorship">protge</a> is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity.<sup id="cite_ref-IGN_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IGN-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking <a href="/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide" title="Lysergic acid diethylamide">LSD</a> to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a <a href="/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quran</a> is found in his possession.<sup id="cite_ref-IGN_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IGN-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p></p>
<p>Twenty-year-old Will Hunting (Damon) of <a href="/wiki/South_Boston" title="South Boston">South Boston</a> is a self-taught, genius-level intellect with an <a href="/wiki/Eidetic_memory" title="Eidetic memory">eidetic memory</a>, though he works simply as a janitor at the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, and spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie (Affleck), Billy (<a href="/wiki/Cole_Hauser" title="Cole Hauser">Cole Hauser</a>) and Morgan (<a href="/wiki/Casey_Affleck" title="Casey Affleck">Casey Affleck</a>). When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Skarsgrd) posts a difficult problem taken from <a href="/wiki/Algebraic_graph_theory" title="Algebraic graph theory">algebraic graph theory</a> as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the graduate students and Lambeau himself. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem and chances upon Will solving it. Fearing he will lose his sole means of (a meager) income, Will flees and skips going into work the next day. That night, Will meets Skylar (Driver), a British orphan about to graduate from <a href="/wiki/Harvard" title="Harvard" class="mw-redirect">Harvard</a>, who plans on attending medical school at <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University_School_of_Medicine" title="Stanford University School of Medicine">Stanford</a>.</p>
<p>Assaulting both a man who bullied him as a child and a police officer who attempts to break up the fight, Will faces incarceration, but Lambeau arranges for him to forgo jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision while simultaneously seeking <a href="/wiki/Psychotherapy" title="Psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a>. Will tentatively agrees but treats his first few therapists with contempt; his refusal to open up is met with staunch defiance by the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeois" title="Bourgeois" class="mw-redirect">bourgeois</a> mentality of the therapists, who each refuse to treat Will further. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire (Williams), his estranged and much more grounded college roommate, who now teaches psychology at <a href="/wiki/Bunker_Hill_Community_College" title="Bunker Hill Community College">Bunker Hill Community College</a>. Unlike the other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's weak defense mechanisms, and after a few unproductive sessions, Will begins to open up.</p>
<p>Will is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife by giving up his ticket to the historic sixth game of the <a href="/wiki/1975_World_Series" title="1975 World Series">1975 World Series</a>, after falling in love at first sight. Sean neither regrets his decision, nor does he regret the final years of his marriage, when his wife was dying of cancer. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean has been unable to move on from his wife's death.</p>
<p>Chafing under Lambeau's high expectations, Will makes a mockery of job interviews that Lambeau arranges for him. He turns down a position for the <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency">National Security Agency</a>, offering a scathing critique of the agency's actions to his interviewer. When Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, he panics and pushes her away, revealing that he is an orphan and that his foster father physically abused him. Skylar tells Will that she loves him, but he refuses and leaves her room. Will next storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. When Will refuses to give an honest reply about what he wants to do with his life, Sean shows him the door. Will tells Chuckie he wants to be a laborer for the rest of his life, Chuckie responds that it would be an insult to his friends for Will to waste his potential and that his fondest wish is that Will should leave to pursue something greater.</p>
<p>Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his future. Sean and Will share that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault. Sean comforts Will as he cries over the 20 years of trauma. Will decides to accept one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau and decides to take a sabbatical to travel the world. When Will's friends present him with a rebuilt <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Nova" title="Chevrolet Nova" class="mw-redirect">Chevrolet Nova</a> for his twenty-first birthday, he decides to pass on his job offers and drive to California to reunite with Skylar. Sometime later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there. Sean comes out of his house and finds a letter from Will in his mailbox, which tells him he is going to see Skylar, much to his pleasure. The credits roll as Will's car is shown driving on the highway to California.</p>
<p>Originally, <a href="/wiki/Matt_Damon" title="Matt Damon">Matt Damon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ben_Affleck" title="Ben Affleck">Ben Affleck</a> wrote the <a href="/wiki/Screenplay#Spec_scripts" title="Screenplay">screenplay</a> as a thriller about a young man in the rough-and-tumble streets of <a href="/wiki/South_Boston" title="South Boston">South Boston</a> who possesses a superior intelligence and is targeted by the FBI to become a <a href="/wiki/G-Man_(slang)" title="G-Man (slang)">G-Man</a>. <a href="/wiki/Castle_Rock_Entertainment" title="Castle Rock Entertainment">Castle Rock Entertainment</a> president <a href="/wiki/Rob_Reiner" title="Rob Reiner">Rob Reiner</a> later urged them to drop the thriller aspect of the story and to focus on the relationship between Will Hunting (Damon) and his psychologist (Williams). At Reiner's request, screenwriter <a href="/wiki/William_Goldman" title="William Goldman">William Goldman</a> read the script and further suggested that the film's climax ought to be Will's decision to follow his girlfriend Skylar to California. Goldman has consistently denied the persistent rumor that he wrote <i>Good Will Hunting</i> or acted as a <a href="/wiki/Script_doctor" title="Script doctor">script doctor</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In his book <i><a href="/wiki/Which_Lie_Did_I_Tell%3F" title="Which Lie Did I Tell?">Which Lie Did I Tell?</a></i>, Goldman jokingly writes, "I did not just doctor it. I wrote the whole thing from scratch." before dismissing the rumour as false.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Castle Rock bought the script for $675,000 against $775,000, meaning that Damon and Affleck would stand to earn an additional $100,000 if the film was produced and they retained sole writing credit. However, studios balked at the idea of Affleck and Damon in the lead roles, with many studio executives stating that they wanted <a href="/wiki/Brad_Pitt" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio" title="Leonardo DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. At the time Damon and Affleck were meeting at Castle Rock, <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Smith" title="Kevin Smith">Kevin Smith</a> was working with Affleck on <i><a href="/wiki/Mallrats" title="Mallrats">Mallrats</a></i> and with both Damon and Affleck on <i><a href="/wiki/Chasing_Amy" title="Chasing Amy">Chasing Amy</a>.</i><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Castle Rock put the script in turnaround, and gave Damon and Affleck 30 days to find another buyer for the script who would reimburse Castle Rock the money paid, otherwise the script reverted to the studio, and Damon and Affleck would be out. All the studios that were involved in the original bidding war for the screenplay now each turned the pair down, taking meetings with Affleck and Damon only to tell them this to their face. As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his <i>Chasing Amy</i> director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into Harvey Weinstein's office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the movie. In his recollection of the meeting, Weinstein asked about an out-of-place, mid-script <a href="/wiki/Oral_sex" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a> scene, which Damon and Affleck explained was a test to see which studio executives had actually read the script.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After buying the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax gave the green light to put the film into production.

Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith if he was interested in directing. He declined, saying they needed a "good director" and that he only directs things he writes and is not much of a visual director. Damon and Affleck later chose <a href="/wiki/Gus_Van_Sant" title="Gus Van Sant">Gus Van Sant</a> for the job, whose work on previous films like <i><a href="/wiki/Drugstore_Cowboy" title="Drugstore Cowboy">Drugstore Cowboy</a></i> (1989) had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters.

<p>In 1976, eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle (<a href="/wiki/Bethany_Whitmore" title="Bethany Whitmore">Bethany Whitmore</a>) lives a lonely life in <a href="/wiki/Mount_Waverley,_Victoria" title="Mount Waverley, Victoria">Mount Waverley</a>, Australia. At school, she is teased by her classmates because of an unfortunate birthmark on her forehead; while at home, her distant father, Noel, and alcoholic, <a href="/wiki/Kleptomaniac" title="Kleptomaniac" class="mw-redirect">kleptomaniac</a> mother, Vera, provide little support. Her only comforts are her pet rooster, Ethel; her favourite food, sweetened <a href="/wiki/Condensed_milk" title="Condensed milk">condensed milk</a>; and a <a href="/wiki/The_Smurfs" title="The Smurfs">Smurfs</a>-like cartoon show called <i>The Noblets</i>. One day, while at the post office with her mother, Mary spots a <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> telephone book and, becoming curious about Americans, decides to write to one. She randomly chooses Max Jerry Horowitz's name from the phone book and writes him a letter telling him about herself, sending it off in the hope that he will become her <a href="/wiki/Pen_pal" title="Pen pal">pen friend</a>.</p>
<p>Max Jerry Horowitz (<a href="/wiki/Philip_Seymour_Hoffman" title="Philip Seymour Hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>) is a <a href="/wiki/Obesity-associated_morbidity" title="Obesity-associated morbidity">morbidly obese</a> 44-year-old ex-<a href="/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jewish</a> <a href="/wiki/Atheism" title="Atheism">atheist</a> who has trouble forming close bonds with other people, due to various mental and social problems. Though Mary's letter initially gives him an <a href="/wiki/Anxiety_attack" title="Anxiety attack" class="mw-redirect">anxiety attack</a>, he decides to write back to her, and the two quickly become friends (partly due to their shared love of chocolate and <i>The Noblets</i>). Due to Vera's disapproval of Max, Mary tells him to send his letters to her <a href="/wiki/Agoraphobia" title="Agoraphobia">agoraphobic</a> neighbour, Len Hislop, whose mail she collects regularly. When Mary later asks Max about <a href="/wiki/Romance_(love)" title="Romance (love)">love</a>, he suffers a severe anxiety attack and is institutionalized for eight months. After his release, he is hesitant to write to Mary again for some time. On his 48th birthday, he wins the New York lottery, using his winnings to buy a lifetime supply of chocolate and an entire collection of Noblet figurines. He gives the rest of his money to his elderly neighbour Ivy, who uses most of it to pamper herself before dying in an accident with a malfunctioning <a href="/wiki/Jet_pack" title="Jet pack">jet pack</a>. Meanwhile, Mary becomes despondent, thinking Max has abandoned her.</p>
<p>On the advice of his therapist, Max finally writes back to Mary and explains he has been diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Asperger_syndrome" title="Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>. Mary is thrilled to hear from him again, and the two continue their correspondence for the next several years. When Noel retires from his job at a tea bag factory, he takes up <a href="/wiki/Metal_detector" title="Metal detector">metal detecting</a>, but is soon swept away (and presumably killed) by a big <a href="/wiki/Tidal_bore" title="Tidal bore">tidal bore</a> while on a beach. Mary (<a href="/wiki/Toni_Colette" title="Toni Colette" class="mw-redirect">Toni Colette</a>) goes to university and has her birthmark surgically removed, and develops a crush on her <a href="/wiki/Greek_Australians" title="Greek Australians">Greek Australian</a> neighbour, Damien Popodopoulos (<a href="/wiki/Eric_Bana" title="Eric Bana">Eric Bana</a>). Drunk and guilt-ridden over her husband's death, Vera accidentally kills herself after she drinks <a href="/wiki/Embalming_chemicals" title="Embalming chemicals">embalming fluid</a> (which she mistook for <a href="/wiki/Classification_of_wine#Other_styles" title="Classification of wine">cooking sherry</a>). Mary and Damien grow closer following Vera's death and are later married.</p>
<p>Inspired by her friendship with Max, Mary studies <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a> at university, writing her doctoral dissertation on Asperger syndrome with Max as her test subject. She plans to have her dissertation published as a book; but when Max receives a copy from her, he is infuriated that she has taken advantage of his condition, which he sees as an integral part of his personality and not a disability that needs to be cured. He breaks off communication with Mary (by removing the letter "M" from his typewriter), who, heartbroken, has the entire run of her book <a href="/wiki/Pulped" title="Pulped" class="mw-redirect">pulped</a>, effectively ending her budding career. She sinks into <a href="/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder" title="Major depressive disorder">depression</a> and begins drinking cooking sherry, as her mother had done. While searching through a cabinet, she finds a can of condensed milk, and sends it to Max as an apology. She checks the post daily for a response and one day finds a note from Damien, informing her that he has left her for his own pen friend, Desmond, a sheep farmer in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after an incident in which he nearly chokes a homeless man (<a href="/wiki/Ian_%22Molly%22_Meldrum" title='Ian "Molly" Meldrum' class="mw-redirect">Ian "Molly" Meldrum</a>) in anger, after throwing a used cigarette, Max realizes Mary is an imperfect human being, like himself, and sends her a package containing his Noblet figurine collection as a sign of forgiveness. Mary, however, has sunken into despair after Damien's departure, and fails to find the package on her doorstep for several days. Finding some <a href="/wiki/Diazepam" title="Diazepam">Valium</a> that had belonged to her mother, and unaware that she is pregnant with Damien's child, Mary decides to commit <a href="/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. As she takes the Valium and is on the verge of hanging herself, Len knocks on her door, having conquered his <a href="/wiki/Agoraphobia" title="Agoraphobia">agoraphobia</a> to alert her of Max's package. Inside, she finds the Noblet figurines and a letter from Max, in which he tells her of his realization that they are not perfect and expresses his forgiveness. He also states how much their friendship means to him, and that he hopes their paths will cross one day.</p>
<p>One year later, Mary travels to New York with her infant child to finally visit Max. Entering his apartment, Mary discovers Max on his couch, gazing upward with a smile on his face, having died earlier that morning. Looking around the apartment, Mary is awestruck to find all the letters she had sent to Max over the years, laminated and taped to the ceiling. Realizing Max had been gazing at the letters when he died, and seeing how much he had valued their friendship, Mary cries tears of joy and joins him on the couch.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Lon Montana (<a href="/wiki/Jean_Reno" title="Jean Reno">Jean Reno</a>) is a Franco-Italian <a href="/wiki/Hitman" title="Hitman" class="mw-redirect">hitman</a> (or "cleaner", as he refers to himself) living a solitary life in New York City's <a href="/wiki/Little_Italy,_Manhattan" title="Little Italy, Manhattan">Little Italy</a>. His work comes from a <a href="/wiki/Mafia" title="Mafia">mafioso</a> named Tony (<a href="/wiki/Danny_Aiello" title="Danny Aiello">Danny Aiello</a>). Lon spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant, and watching old films.</p>
<p>One day, Lon sees Mathilda Lando (<a href="/wiki/Natalie_Portman" title="Natalie Portman">Natalie Portman</a>), a twelve-year-old girl who is smoking a cigarette and sporting a black eye. Mathilda lives with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hall. Her abusive father and self-absorbed stepmother have not noticed that Mathilda stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda's father (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Badalucco" title="Michael Badalucco">Michael Badalucco</a>) attracts the ire of corrupt <a href="/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration" title="Drug Enforcement Administration">DEA</a> agents, who have been paying him to stash <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> in his apartment. After they discover he has been cutting the cocaine to keep some for himself, DEAagents storm the building, led by sharply dressed drug addict <a href="/wiki/Norman_Stansfield" title="Norman Stansfield">Norman Stansfield</a> (<a href="/wiki/Gary_Oldman" title="Gary Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>). During the raid, Stansfield quickly becomes unhinged and murders Mathilda's entire family one by one while Mathilda is out shopping. When Mathilda returns, she realizes what has happened just in time to continue down the hall, where she desperately knocks on her neighbour's door. A hesitant Lon gives her shelter.</p>
<p>Mathilda quickly discovers that Lon is a hitman. She begs him to take care of her and to teach her his skills, as she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother. At first, Lon is unsettled by her presence. He even almost kills her in her sleep, possibly out of mercy, but can't bring himself to do it. The next morning, Lon tries to throw Mathilda out, but she claims that, because he saved her life the previous day, he is now responsible for her, stating that she would be dead by the end of the day if he threw her out and it would be like he had never opened the door for her. She begs him to train her as a "cleaner," demonstrating her willingness to learn by taking Lon's gun and firing randomly onto the street outside his open window. Reluctantly, Lon trains Mathilda and shows her how to use various weapons. In return, she runs his errands, cleans his apartment, and teaches him how to read. Mathilda tells Lon she loves him several times, but he offers no response.</p>
<p>One day after Mathilda has learned how to shoot, she fills a bag with guns from Lon's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery girl, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. Mathilda learns from Stansfield that Lon killed one of the corrupt DEA agents in Chinatown that morning. Lon, after discovering her plan in a note left for him, rescues Mathilda, shooting two more of Stansfield's men in the process. A now enraged Stansfield goes to find Tony, and assaults him in order to find out where Lon is.</p>
<p>When Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department_Emergency_Service_Unit" title="New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit">NYPD ESU</a> team sent by Stansfield captures her and attempts to infiltrate Lon's apartment. Lon ambushes the ESU team and grabs Mathilda. Back in his apartment, Lon creates a quick escape for Mathilda by smashing a hole in an air shaft. He reassures her and tells her that he loves her and that she has given him "a taste for life", moments before the police come for him. In the chaos that follows, Lon sneaks out of the building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He goes unnoticed save for Stansfield, who recognizes him, follows him downstairs and shoots him in the back. As he is dying, Lon places an object in Stansfield's hands that he says is "from Mathilda". Opening his hands, Stansfield discovers that it is the pin from a grenade. He then opens Lon's vest to find a cluster of active grenades, which detonate moments later, killing them both.</p>
<p>Mathilda heads to see Tony, as Lon had instructed her to do before he died. Tony reveals to Mathilda that Lon instructed him to give his money to her if anything happened to him. He offers to hold the money and provide it to her on an allowance basis, on account of her youth. Mathilda asks Tony to give her a job as a hitman; Tony angrily declines, telling Mathilda to forget about her ordeal and return to school. Mathilda meets with the school headmistress, who readmits her after Mathilda tells her what had happened in the past several days and if the headmistress doesn't help her now, Mathilda would be dead by the end of the day. She then walks into a field near the school to plant Lon's houseplant, as she had told Lon he should, to give it roots.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home when her father takes a wrong turn. They enter what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, which Chihiro's father insists on exploring. Chihiro's parents sit at an empty but seemingly operational restaurant and begin to devour the fresh food in a piggish manner; meanwhile, Chihiro discovers an exquisite <a href="/wiki/Sent%C5%8D" title="Sent">bathhouse</a> across a bridge, where a young boy named Haku warns her to get out before the impending sunset. Frantically, Chihiro returns to her parents, only to discover that they have transformed into pigs. She attempts to escape, but the way by which they came has since become submerged. Frightened and alone, she observes as the world she ventured into reveals itself as a luxurious retreat for spirits to revitalize themselves.</p>
<p>Haku finds Chihiro and advises her to demand a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a <a href="/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai" title="Ykai">spider-like being</a> who prepares requested treatments for guests. Kamaji and Lin, one of the employees there, send Chihiro to Yubaba, the cruel and tyrannical owner of the bathhouse. While she initially refuses Chihiro's service, Yubaba reluctantly hires her in exchange for her identity, renaming her Sen <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja"></span><sup class="t_nihongo_help noprint"><a href="/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets" title="Help:Installing Japanese character sets"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color: #00e; font: bold 80% sans-serif; text-decoration: none; padding: 0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup>)</span>. Haku takes Sen to visit her parents' pigpen and returns her clothes. Within, Sen finds a goodbye card from a friend with her real name written on it. Haku tells her that Yubaba controls people by taking their names and that she will become trapped in the spirit world if she forgets her name, as he has.</p>
<p>While working, Sen invites a silent, masked creature named No-Face inside the bathhouse, believing him to be a customer. A "stink spirit" subsequently arrives, and Sen is quickly assigned to tend to the guest by her nauseated superiors. She discovers he is actually the powerful guardian spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic <a href="/wiki/Emetic" title="Emetic" class="mw-redirect">emetic</a> <a href="/wiki/Dumpling" title="Dumpling">dumpling</a>. Sen is congratulated by her gleeful coworkers, who had shunned her as an outsider. Later, while most of the staff sleep, No-Face tempts a worker with gold. The greedy employee takes the bait only to be swallowed whole. No-Face begins demanding food, producing gold to tempt the naive staff. As the workers swarm him, hoping to be tipped, he devours two of them and grows larger.</p>
<p>Sen discovers paper <a href="/wiki/Shikigami" title="Shikigami">shikigami</a> attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku transformed. When a grievously-injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. When she reaches Haku, a shikigami that stowed away on her back transforms into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She transforms Yubaba's baby son Boh into a mouse, creates a decoy baby, and turns Yubaba's pet bird creature into a tiny, fly-like bird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden <a href="/wiki/Seal_(emblem)" title="Seal (emblem)">seal</a> from her and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. After Haku dives to the boiler room with Sen and Boh on his back, she feeds him part of the dumpling, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.</p>
<p>With Haku unconscious, Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize for Haku. Before she leaves the bathhouse, Sen confronts the now-massive No-Face and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face chases Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily vomiting out those he has eaten and thus gradually returning to his former self. Sen, No-Face, Boh, and the bird creature travel to see Zeniba. Enraged at the damage caused by No-Face, Yubaba blames Sen for inviting him in and orders that her parents be slaughtered. After Haku reveals that Boh is missing, he promises to retrieve Boh in exchange for Yubaba freeing Sen and her parents.</p>
<p>Sen, No-Face, Boh, and the bird creature arrive at Zeniba's house. Zeniba, now the benevolent "Granny," reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba had used the black slug to control him. Haku appears in his dragon form and flies both Sen and Boh back to the bathhouse. No-Face unexpectedly shows itself as a very good <a href="/wiki/Spinning_(textiles)" title="Spinning (textiles)">spinner</a> for Zeniba and accepts her proposal to stay as a helper.</p>
<p>On the way back, Sen recalls a memory from her youth in which she had fallen into the Kohaku River while trying to retrieve her fallen shoe but was swept safely ashore. After correctly guessing that Haku is the spirit of the Kohaku River (and thus revealing his real name), Haku is freed from Yubaba's control. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba tells Sen that in order to break the curse on her parents, she must identify them from among a group of pigs. Sen correctly states that none of the pigs are her parents, releasing her parents from the curse and herself from her contract with Yubaba. Haku takes her to the entrance to the spirit world and promises to see her again in the future. Chihiro reunites with her restored parents, who do not remember what happened. They walk back to their car, which has become covered in fallen leaves and dust after days passed in their absence, and drive away.</p>
<p>Every summer, <a href="/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki" title="Hayao Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for <i>Spirited Away</i> came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films such as <i><a href="/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro" title="My Neighbor Totoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Kiki%27s_Delivery_Service" title="Kiki's Delivery Service">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></i>, which were for small children and teenagers, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read <a href="/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_manga" title="Shjo manga">shjo manga</a> magazines like <i><a href="/wiki/Nakayoshi" title="Nakayoshi">Nakayoshi</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Ribon" title="Ribon">Ribon</a></i> the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on "crushes" and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they "held dear in their hearts" and decided to produce the film about a girl heroine whom they could look up to instead.<sup id="cite_ref-nausicaa_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nausicaa-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Miyazaki wanted to produce a new film for years, he previously wrote two project proposals, but they were rejected. The first one was based on the Japanese book <i>Kirino Mukouno Fushigina Machi</i>, and the second one was about a teenage heroine. Miyazaki's third proposal, which ended up becoming <i>Sen and Chihiro Spirited Away</i>, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was based on a bathhouse in Miyazaki's hometown. Miyazaki thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bathhouse. Miyazaki was always curious to what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it; one of which was the inspiration for the bathhouse in <i>Spirited Away</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-nausicaa_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nausicaa-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Production of <i>Spirited Away</i> commenced in 2000 on a budget of <a href="/wiki/Japanese_yen" title="Japanese yen"></a>1.9 billion (US$19 million).<sup id="cite_ref-howe_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-howe-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Disney invested 10% of the cost for the <a href="/wiki/Right_of_first_refusal" title="Right of first refusal">right of first refusal</a> for American distribution.<sup id="cite_ref-fps_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-fps-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> As with <i><a href="/wiki/Princess_Mononoke" title="Princess Mononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></i>, Miyazaki and the <a href="/wiki/Studio_Ghibli" title="Studio Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as <a href="/wiki/Autodesk_Softimage" title="Autodesk Softimage">Softimage</a>, the staff learned the software, but kept the technology at a level to enhance the story, not to "steal the show". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.<sup id="cite_ref-howe_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-howe-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production started, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the "eye-candy" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a "pretty girl." At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked "dull" and thought, "She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel "she will be a charming woman."<sup id="cite_ref-nausicaa_11-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nausicaa-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Miyazaki based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the buildings in the real-life <a href="/wiki/Edo-Tokyo_Open_Air_Architectural_Museum" title="Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum">Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum</a> in <a href="/wiki/Koganei,_Tokyo" title="Koganei, Tokyo">Koganei, Tokyo</a>, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had always been interested in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the <a href="/wiki/Meiji_period" title="Meiji period">Meiji period</a> that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, "especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting tears well up in my eyes."<sup id="cite_ref-nausicaa_11-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nausicaa-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Another major inspiration was the Notoyaryokan, a <a href="/wiki/Ryokan_(Japanese_inn)" title="Ryokan (Japanese inn)" class="mw-redirect">traditional Japanese inn</a> located in <a href="/wiki/Yamagata_Prefecture" title="Yamagata Prefecture">Yamagata Prefecture</a>, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The old gold town of <a href="/wiki/Jiufen" title="Jiufen">Jiufen</a> in <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> also served as an inspirational model for Miyazaki's film.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/D%C5%8Dgo_Onsen" title="Dgo Onsen">Dgo Onsen</a> is also often said to be a key inspiration for the Spirited Away onsen/bathhouse.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing Western dress and living among European dcor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employee's quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its <a href="/wiki/Meiji_period" title="Meiji period">meiji period</a> and beyond.

<p>In 2005, elderly Daisy Fuller is on her deathbed in a <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> hospital as <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> approaches; she asks her daughter, Caroline, to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button.</p>
<p>From the reading, it is revealed that on the evening of <a href="/wiki/Armistice_Day" title="Armistice Day">November 11, 1918</a>, a boy is born with the appearance and physical maladies of an elderly man. The baby's mother died after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. "Tizzy" Weathers, workers at the nursing home, find the baby, and Queenie decides to care for him as her own.</p>
<p>Benjamin learns to walk in 1925; he declares it a miracle, after which he uses crutches in place of a wheelchair. On Thanksgiving 1930, Benjamin meets seven-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. He and Daisy become good friends. Later, he accepts work on a <a href="/wiki/Tugboat" title="Tugboat">tugboat</a> captained by Mike Clark. Benjamin also meets Thomas Button, who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In Autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans for a long-term work engagement with the tugboat crew; Daisy later is accepted into a dance company in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> under choreographer George Balanchine.</p>
<p>In 1941, Benjamin is in <a href="/wiki/Murmansk" title="Murmansk">Murmansk</a>, where he begins having an affair with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the British Trade Minister. That December, Japan <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attacks Pearl Harbor</a>, thrusting the United States into <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Mike volunteers the boat for the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Navy" title="U.S. Navy" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Navy</a>; the crew is assigned to salvage duties. During a patrol, the tugboat finds a sunken U.S. transport and the bodies of many American troops. A German submarine surfaces; Mike steers the tugboat full speed towards it while a German gunner fires on the tugboat, killing most of the crew, including Mike. The tugboat rams the submarine, causing it to explode, sinking both vessels. Benjamin and another crewman are rescued by U.S. Navy ships the next day.</p>
<p>In May 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans and reunites with Queenie. A few weeks later, he reunites with Daisy; they go out for dinner. Upon failing to seduce him afterward, she departs. Benjamin later reunites with Thomas Button, who, terminally ill, reveals he is Benjamin's father and wills Benjamin his button company and his estate.</p>
<p>In 1947, Benjamin visits Daisy in New York unannounced but departs upon seeing that she has fallen in love with someone else. In 1954, Daisy's dancing career ends when her leg is crushed in an automobile accident in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>. When Benjamin visits her, Daisy is amazed by his youthful appearance, but, frustrated by her injuries, she tells him to stay out of her life.</p>
<p>In spring 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love and go sailing together. They return to learn that Queenie has died, then move in together. In 1967, Daisy, who has opened a ballet studio, tells Benjamin that she is pregnant; she gives birth to a girl, Caroline, in the spring of 1968. Believing he can not be a proper father to his daughter due to his reverse aging, Benjamin departs after selling his belongings, leaving a bank account book holding the proceeds behind for Daisy and Caroline; he travels alone during the 1970s.</p>
<p>Benjamin returns to Daisy in 1980. Now married, Daisy introduces him, as a family friend, to her husband and daughter. Daisy admits that he was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. She later visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they again share their passion for each other, then part once more.</p>
<p>In 1990, widowed Daisy is contacted by social workers who have found Benjaminnow physically a pre-teen. When she arrives, they explain that he was living in a condemned building and was taken to the hospital in poor physical condition, and that they found her name in his diary. The bewildered social workers also say he is displaying early signs of <a href="/wiki/Dementia" title="Dementia">dementia</a>. Daisy moves into the nursing home in 1997 and cares for Benjamin for the rest of his life. In the spring of 2003, Benjamin dies in Daisy's arms, physically an infant but chronologically 84 years of age. Having finally revealed the story of Caroline's father to her, Daisy dies as <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> approaches.</p>

<p>In 1981, <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> salesman Chris Gardner (<a href="/wiki/Will_Smith" title="Will Smith">Will Smith</a>) invests his entire life savings in portable <a href="/wiki/Bone_density" title="Bone density">bone density</a> scanners, which he demonstrates to doctors and pitches as a handy quantum leap over standard X-rays. The scanners play a vital role in Chris' life. While he is able to sell most of them, the time lag between the sales and his growing financial demands enrage his already bitter and alienated wife Linda (<a href="/wiki/Thandie_Newton" title="Thandie Newton">Thandie Newton</a>), who works as a hotel maid. The financial instability increasingly erodes their marriage, in spite of them caring for their five-year-old son, Christopher (<a href="/wiki/Jaden_Smith" title="Jaden Smith">Jaden Smith</a>).</p>
<p>While downtown trying to sell one of the scanners, Gardner meets Jay Twistle (Brian Howe), a manager for <a href="/wiki/Dean_Witter_Reynolds" title="Dean Witter Reynolds">Dean Witter Reynolds</a> and impresses him by solving a <a href="/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube" title="Rubik's Cube">Rubik's Cube</a> during a short taxi ride. After Jay leaves, Gardner lacks money to pay the fare, and chooses to run, resulting in the driver chasing him into a <a href="/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit" title="Bay Area Rapid Transit">BART</a> station. Gardner boards a train but loses one of his scanners in the process. His new relationship with Jay earns him the chance to become an intern stockbroker. The day before the interview, Gardner grudgingly agrees to paint his apartment so as to postpone being evicted due to his difficulty in paying the rent. While painting, Gardner is greeted by two policemen at his doorstep, who take him to the station, stating he has to pay for his numerous parking tickets he has accumulated. As part of the sanction, Gardner is ordered to spend the night in jail, complicating his schedule for the interview the next morning. He manages to arrive at Dean Witter's office on time, albeit still in his shabby clothes. Despite his appearance, he impresses the interviewers, and lands an internship. He will be amongst 20 interns competing for a paid position as a <a href="/wiki/Broker" title="Broker">broker</a>.</p>
<p>Gardner's unpaid internship does not please Linda, who eventually leaves for New York. After Gardner bluntly says she is incapable of being a single mother, she agrees that Christopher will remain with his father. Gardner is further set back when his bank account is garnished by the IRS for unpaid income taxes, and he and his young son are evicted. He ends up with less than twenty-two dollars, resulting in them being homeless, and are forced at one point to stay in a restroom at a BART station. Other days, he and Christopher spend nights at a homeless shelter, in BART, or, if he manages to procure cash, at a hotel. Later, Gardner finds the bone scanner that he lost in the station and, after repairing it, sells it to a physician, thus completing all his sales of his scanners.</p>
<p>Disadvantaged by his limited work hours, and knowing that maximizing his client contacts and profits is the only way to earn the broker position, Gardner develops a number of ways to make phone sales calls more efficiently, including reaching out to potential high value customers, defying protocol. One sympathetic prospect who is a top-level pension fund manager even takes him and his son to a <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> game. Regardless of his challenges, he never reveals his lowly circumstances to his colleagues, even going so far as to lend one of his bosses five dollars for cab fare, a sum that he cannot afford. Concluding his internship, Gardner is called into a meeting with his managers. One of them notes he is wearing a new shirt. Gardner explains it is his last day and thought to dress for the occasion. The manager smiles and says he should wear it again tomorrow, letting him know he has won the coveted full-time position. Fighting back tears, Gardner shakes hands with them, then rushes to his son's daycare to embrace Christopher. They walk down the street, joking with each other and are passed by a man in a business suit (the real Chris Gardner in a cameo appearance). The epilogue reveals that Gardner went on to form his own multimillion-dollar brokerage firm.</p>

A <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashback</a> of the events leading to his sentence ensues, narrated by Louis as he writes his memoirs.</p>
<p>After his mother, a daughter of the seventh Duke of Chalfont, elopes with an Italian opera singer named Mazzini (also played by Price), she is disowned by the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family for marrying beneath her station. The couple are poor but happy, until Mazzini dies upon seeing Louis, his newborn son, for the first time. Louis' mother teaches him her family's pedigree. Louis's only childhood friends are Sibella (<a href="/wiki/Joan_Greenwood" title="Joan Greenwood">Joan Greenwood</a>) and her brother, a local doctor's children.</p>
<p>When Louis leaves school, his mother writes to her kinsman Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, a <a href="/wiki/Private_bank" title="Private bank">private banker</a>, for assistance in launching her son's career, but receives only another snub. Louis is forced to work as an assistant in a draper's shop. When Louis's mother dies, her last request, to be interred in the family <a href="/wiki/Burial_vault_(tomb)" title="Burial vault (tomb)">vault</a>, also goes unanswered.</p>

After Louis quarrels with customer Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, the banker's only child, Ascoyne has Louis dismissed from his job. Louis then resolves to kill him and the other seven people (all played by Alec Guinness) ahead of him in succession to the dukedom.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>Note 1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After arranging a fatal boating accident for Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, Louis writes a letter of condolence to his victim's father, Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, who relents and employs him as a clerk. Gradually becoming a man of means, Louis rents a bachelor flat in St James's and commences an affair with Sibella.</p>
<p>He next targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He is also charmed by Henry's wife, Edith (<a href="/wiki/Valerie_Hobson" title="Valerie Hobson">Valerie Hobson</a>). After fatally substituting petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's <a href="/wiki/Darkroom" title="Darkroom">darkroom</a>, Louis attends the funeral and views for the first time the remaining D'Ascoynes.</p>
<p>He later approaches the Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne, posing as a retired colonial bishop, and poisons his <a href="/wiki/Port_(wine)" title="Port (wine)" class="mw-redirect">port</a>.</p>

<p>Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a difficulty, as he rarely sets foot on land, but he conveniently insists on <a href="/wiki/Captain_goes_down_with_the_ship" title="Captain goes down with the ship" class="mw-redirect">going down with his ship</a> after causing a collision at sea. This episode is loosely based on the death of <a href="/wiki/George_Tryon" title="George Tryon">Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon</a> in 1893.</p>
<p>Edith agrees to marry Louis. They notify Ethelred, the childless, widowed eighth duke, who invites them to spend a few days at the family seat, Chalfont Castle. Ethelred casually informs Louis that he intends to marry again to produce an heir. To forestall this, Louis stages a shooting "accident", but before murdering the duke he reveals his motive.</p>
<p>Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne dies from the shock of learning that he has acceded to the dukedom, thus sparing Louis a murder he would have been reluctant to commit. Louis becomes the tenth duke and is welcomed by his new tenants, but his triumph is short-lived: a <a href="/wiki/Scotland_Yard" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard</a> detective arrests him for murder.</p>
<p>Lionel had been found dead following Louis's rejection of his drunken plea for help to avoid bankruptcy. When Louis is charged with his murder, he elects to be <a href="/wiki/Privilege_of_peerage#Trial_by_peers" title="Privilege of peerage">tried by his peers</a> in the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>.

Sibella, in love with him and having an inkling of Louis' crimes, falsely testifies that Lionel was about to seek a divorce, naming Louis as <a href="/wiki/Co-respondent" title="Co-respondent">co-respondent</a>. Ironically, Louis is convicted of a death that he had not even contemplated.</p>
<p>Louis is visited in prison by Sibella, who observes that the discovery of Lionel's suicide note and the sudden death of Edith would free Louis and enable them to marry, a tacit proposal to which he agrees. Moments before the hanging, news of the discovery of the suicide note reaches the prison governor.</p>
<p>Outside the prison, Louis finds both Edith and Sibella waiting for him. Pondering his dilemma, he quotes from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Beggar%27s_Opera" title="The Beggar's Opera">The Beggar's Opera</a></i>: "How happy could I be with either, Were t'other dear charmer away!" When a reporter approaches to tell him that <i><a href="/wiki/Tit-Bits" title="Tit-Bits">Tit-Bits</a></i> magazine wishes to publish his memoirs, Louis suddenly remembers the detailed written confession he left in his cell.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Arthur Bishop works as a "<a href="/wiki/Hitman" title="Hitman" class="mw-redirect">mechanic</a>". He sneaks into the lavish home of a Colombian Drug Cartel leader and discreetly drowns him in his own pool. Upon returning to his home in Louisiana, he later meets with his friend and mentor, Harry McKenna, who pays Bishop for his work.</p>
<p>Later, Bishop finds that his new assignment is to kill Harry. Bishop's employer confirms by phone that the contract is correct, whereupon Bishop requests a face-to-face meeting. Dean tells Bishop about a failed mission in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, in which assassins of Bishop's agency were killed. Dean relates that only two people knew about the missionhimself and Harryand that Harry had been paid for the contract details. Bishop reluctantly kills Harry with his own gun and makes it look like a <a href="/wiki/Carjacking" title="Carjacking">carjacking</a>. At Harry's funeral, Bishop meets Harry's reckless son Steve, who swears vengeance anyway he can. Bishop stops Steve from trying to bait and kill a would-be carjacker and decides to train him as a mechanic. He adopts a <a href="/wiki/Chihuahua_(dog)" title="Chihuahua (dog)">chihuahua</a> and instructs Steve to take the dog with him to a coffee shop each day at the same time. As Steve settles in to his routine, Bishop escalates his training by taking him to observe a contract kill.</p>
<p>Bishop later gives Steve a contract of his own. The target is a mechanic for another agency named Burke, who frequents the same coffee shop as Steve. Burke's only weaknesses are that he is interested in young men and small dogs. Burke makes his move on Steve and invites him out for drinks. Bishop instructs Steve to slip a large dose of <a href="/wiki/Flunitrazepam" title="Flunitrazepam">Rohypnol</a> into Burke's drink to cause an <a href="/wiki/Drug_overdose" title="Drug overdose">overdose</a>. Steve ignores the instructions and instead goes with Burke to his apartment. Burke begins to undress, and Steve attempts to <a href="/wiki/Strangle" title="Strangle" class="mw-redirect">strangle</a> him with a belt as Bishop had done with an earlier assignment. Steve manages to kill Burke after much effort and a lengthy fight. Dean expresses his disapproval of Bishop's use of Steve for the Burke contract, but Bishop replies that he was given that contract through Harry and not Dean.</p>
<p>Bishop is given a contract to kill Andrew Vaughn, the leader of a <a href="/wiki/Cult" title="Cult">cult-like church</a>. Steve and Bishop plan to inject Vaughn with <a href="/wiki/Adrenaline" title="Adrenaline" class="mw-redirect">adrenaline</a> to simulate a <a href="/wiki/Heart_attack" title="Heart attack" class="mw-redirect">heart attack</a>, for which the paramedics would administer a fatal dose of <a href="/wiki/Epinephrine" title="Epinephrine">epinephrine</a>. A doctor arrives and sets Vaughn up with an <a href="/wiki/Intravenous_therapy" title="Intravenous therapy">IV</a> of <a href="/wiki/Ketamine" title="Ketamine">ketamine</a>, which would inhibit the epinephrine's effects. They improvise and suffocate him in his hotel room, but are discovered and forced into a shootout with the guards. They slip out while the building is being evacuated and fly home separately.</p>
<p>At the airport, Bishop sees a supposed victim of the mission that Harry allegedly sold out. Bishop realizes that Dean had tricked him into killing Harry, and that Dean engineered the failed mission to cover up his own shady dealings. Later, Bishop is ambushed by a hit squad. After killing them, he discovers that Dean was behind the hit. Bishop goes home to call Steve, only to find that Steve has also been ambushed at Bishop's house. Bishop directs Steve to a hidden gun, which Steve uses to kill his ambushers. Bishop has Steve gather supplies for their new mission while he plots how to get to Dean. In the process, Steve finds his father's gun and realizes that Bishop killed Harry.</p>
<p>Bishop and Steve kill Dean in an ambush. On the way back, Bishop notices Steve carrying Harry's gun. When they stop for gas, Steve floods the ground with fuel while pretending to fill the truck. He walks to a safe distance and shoots the gas, blowing up Bishop's truck with Bishop still inside. Steve returns to Bishop's house and performs two actions that Bishop told him not to do: playing a record on the <a href="/wiki/Phonograph" title="Phonograph">turntable</a>, and taking the 1966 <a href="/wiki/Jaguar_E-Type" title="Jaguar E-Type">Jaguar E-Type</a> Bishop had been working on. As he is driving away, Steve notices a note on the passenger seat: "Steve, if you're reading this, then you're dead!" Moments later, the car explodes, killing him. At the same time, Bishop's house also explodes. Back at the gas station, a security video reveals that Bishop had escaped from the truck, seconds before the explosion. Bishop gets into a spare truck he had by the beach and drives away.</p>

<p>The film begins with a <a href="/wiki/Voice-over" title="Voice-over">voice-over</a> introduction by Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian-American" title="Ukrainian-American" class="mw-redirect">Ukrainian-American</a> <a href="/wiki/Arms_trafficking" title="Arms trafficking">gunrunner</a>: Over 550 million firearms worldwide means one firearm per twelve people on the planet; he wonders how to arm the other eleven. Opening credits are set to the <a href="/wiki/Buffalo_Springfield" title="Buffalo Springfield">Buffalo Springfield</a> song "<a href="/wiki/For_What_It%27s_Worth_(Buffalo_Springfield_song)" title="For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)">For What It's Worth</a>", and depict the life of a <a href="/wiki/7.62%C3%9739mm" title="7.6239mm">7.6239mm</a> cartridge from construction in a <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> weapons factory, to being shipped across the world to an African warzone, loaded into the magazine of an <a href="/wiki/AK-47" title="AK-47">AK-47</a>, and fired into the head of a child soldier.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Yuri is visiting a <a href="/wiki/Brighton_Beach" title="Brighton Beach">Brighton Beach</a> restaurant, where a <a href="/wiki/Russian_Mafia" title="Russian Mafia" class="mw-redirect">Russian mobster</a> kills two would-be assassins. He is inspired to go into the arms trade, comparing the constant need for weapons to the similar human need for food. At his father's synagogue, he contacts an Israeli to obtain an illegal <a href="/wiki/Uzi" title="Uzi">Uzi</a>. After completing the first sale, Yuri convinces his brother Vitaly (<a href="/wiki/Jared_Leto" title="Jared Leto">Jared Leto</a>) to become his partner, and they leave their jobs at the family restaurant behind.</p>
<p>Yuri's first big break comes in the <a href="/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War" title="1982 Lebanon War">1982 Lebanon War</a>, when he sells guns to all sides of the conflict, despite witnessing war crimes and atrocities. As Yuri becomes more successful in the war's aftermath, his business comes to the attention of <a href="/wiki/Interpol" title="Interpol">Interpol</a>, and in particular idealistic agent Jack Valentine (<a href="/wiki/Ethan_Hawke" title="Ethan Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a>). Valentine is after glory rather than money, making it impossible for Yuri to bribe him as he does other government agents within Interpol and elsewhere in 1989.</p>
<p>During a sale in Colombia, a <a href="/wiki/Drug_lord" title="Drug lord">drug lord</a> pays with six kilos of <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> instead of cash, and shoots Yuri with one of his own pistols when the two argue. Yuri relents, later finding the sale of the cocaine paid better than money would have. After sampling their profits, Vitaly becomes heavily addicted and absconds with an entire kilogram, prompting a lengthy search before he is discovered in a remote village. After several months, Yuri checks Vitaly into <a href="/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation" title="Drug rehabilitation">rehab</a>, and continues alone. He lures childhood crush Ava Fontaine (<a href="/wiki/Bridget_Moynahan" title="Bridget Moynahan">Bridget Moynahan</a>) to a false photo shoot and subsequently marries her. They later have a son, Nikolai (Nicky).</p>
<p>Yuri's second big break is the <a href="/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Dissolution of the Soviet Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a>. After <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> resigns on Christmas Day 1991, Yuri flies to <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and illegally buys tanks and weapons through his uncle, a former <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> General. Expansion to Africa leads to Andre Baptiste Sr. (<a href="/wiki/Eamonn_Walker" title="Eamonn Walker">Eamonn Walker</a>), a ruthless dictator waging a never-ending civil war in <a href="/wiki/Liberia" title="Liberia">Liberia</a>. During one flight into Africa, Yuri's cargo plane is intercepted and forced to land by a fighter jet commandeered by Jack Valentine and Interpol. He escapes arrest by landing outside the nearby city, and by simply handing out the cargo to locals, he ensures no weapons are on the plane by the time Valentine arrives. Surveillance of Yuri and his activities continues at his home in the United States, however. Unable to charge Yuri, Valentine tells Ava he is an <a href="/wiki/Arms_trafficking" title="Arms trafficking">arms dealer</a>, prompting her to confront him and demand he stop his illegal business. For a time, Yuri agrees, but Andre Baptiste Sr. offers him even more money and soon he goes back.</p>
<p>Yuri soon goes to complete a sale in Africa in 2001, where a militia force allied with Andre Baptiste Sr. is visibly preparing to destroy a refugee camp. When Vitaly sees the militia hack an escaping woman and child to death with a <a href="/wiki/Machete" title="Machete">machete</a>, he pleads with Yuri to walk away. Yuri refuses; if he backs out, the militia will simply kill the Orlov brothers along with the refugees. Stricken with guilt, Vitaly steals a pair of grenades, destroying one of the weapons trucks and killing Baptiste Jr. Before he can reach the second truck, he is gunned down by RUF soldiers. Before expiring, Vitaly attempts to arm the remaining grenade but is prevented by Yuri, who surrenders it to the soldiers. Yuri reluctantly accepts half of the original diamond payment for the remaining weapons.</p>
<p>At home, Ava has discovered Yuri's cache of his arms dealing activities. She leaves with their son while Yuri's parents disown him after learning the circumstances surrounding the death of Vitaly and the true extent of Yuri's activities. When the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Customs" title="U.S. Customs" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Customs</a> finds a bullet in Vitaly's corpse, Valentine arrests Yuri, who predicts correctly that a knock at the door will signal his release as a "necessary evil" who distributes weapons so major governments can deny involvement. Despite his losses, Yuri returns to arms dealing. Yuri remarks that it's what he does best, and that arms dealers are most likely to inherit the world one day "because everyone else is too busy killing each other." His final advice to the viewer is, "Never go to war, especially with yourself."</p>
<p>An onscreen postscript states that private dealers conduct less business than the five largest arms exporters the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, and <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> who are the five permanent members of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">United Nations Security Council</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In 1935, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old girl from a wealthy English family and has just finished writing a play. Briony attempts to stage the play with her three visiting cousins, twin boys and their teenage sister, Lola; however, they get bored and decide to go swimming. Briony stays behind and witnesses a significant moment of <a href="/wiki/Sexual_tension" title="Sexual tension">sexual tension</a> between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, a servant's son (a man that Briony has a childish infatuation with). Robbie returns home and writes several drafts of letters to Cecilia, including one that is explicitly sexual and erotically charged. Initially written for the sake of humour, he does not intend to send it and sets it aside. On his way to join the Tallis family for dinner, Robbie asks Briony to deliver his letter, only to later realise that he has mistakenly given her the prurient draft. Briony secretly reads the letter and is simultaneously disgusted and jealous. She tells Lola of its contents and they call Robbie a sex maniac while debating whether to turn him into the police. That afternoon, Lola and her younger brothers meet a friend of the Tallis family, a wealthy chocolate manufacturer named Paul Marshall. Though he is much older than her, he excites Lola by flirting with her and treating her like an adult.</p>
<p>That evening, Cecilia confronts Robbie about the letter which she has since read. They meet in the library where they make love and tenderly confess their love for one another. During the act, Briony watches through the partially open door and her confused emotions about Robbie become heightened. At dinner it is revealed that Lola's twin brothers have run away; a search party is sent out and Briony goes off alone into the woods looking for them. She eventually stumbles upon a man running away from apparently raping Lola. Lola claims that she does not know the identity of her attacker, but then claims it was Robbie after Briony suggests that it must have been the sex maniac who attacked her. In a fit of pique, the still-hurt Briony tells everyone (including the police) that she saw Robbie commit the act. She shows Robbie's shocking letter to her mother and the police. Everyone believes Briony's story except for Cecilia and Robbie's mother; Robbie is arrested and sent to prison.</p>
<p>Four years later, Robbie is released from prison on condition that he join the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" title="British Army">army</a>. He is assigned to A Company, 1st Battalion, <a href="/wiki/Royal_Sussex_Regiment" title="Royal Sussex Regiment">Royal Sussex Regiment</a> and sent to France, where he is separated from his unit and attempts to return to them at <a href="/wiki/Dunkirk" title="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a> on foot. He is then shown reuniting with Cecilia (who has not spoken with her family since the incident) in London six months earlier, where they renew their love before he is shipped off to the French front. Briony, now 18, has joined Cecilia's old nursing corps at St. Thomas's in London because she wants to be of some practical use to society after giving up an offer she received from Cambridge. Her attempts at contacting her sister go unanswered as Cecilia cannot forgive her for Robbie's unjust imprisonment. Robbie, gravely ill and wounded, finally arrives at the beaches of Dunkirk where he waits to be <a href="/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation" title="Dunkirk evacuation">evacuated</a>.</p>
<p>Sometime later, Brionyat last fully understanding the consequences of her false accusationvisits the now-married Cecilia and Robbie to apologise to them directly. However, her apologies are rather weak and ineffectual; Cecilia coldly replies that she will never forgive her, while Robbie, in a rage that almost becomes physical, confronts Briony and demands that she immediately tell her family and the authorities the truth. Briony admits she knew all along that the real rapist was Paul Marshall, but that Lola cannot testify against him in a court of law because they have recently been married.</p>
<p>Decades later, an elderly Briony (now a published author) gives an interview about her latest book, a semi-autobiographical novel called Atonement. She reveals that she is dying of <a href="/wiki/Vascular_dementia" title="Vascular dementia">vascular dementia</a> and states that this last book is one she has been working on for most of her adult life. Briony confesses that the book's ending (in which she apologises to a married Cecilia and Robbie) is fictional: Cecilia and Robbie were never married and never saw each other again once he left for war. In reality, Robbie died at Dunkirk of <a href="/wiki/Sepsis" title="Sepsis">septicemia</a> while awaiting evacuation and Cecilia died a few months later as one of the flood victims in the <a href="/wiki/Balham_station#Second_World_War" title="Balham station">Balham tube station</a> bombing during <a href="/wiki/The_Blitz" title="The Blitz">The Blitz</a>. Briony hopes that by reuniting them in fiction she can give them the happy ending they always deserved. The last scene of the movie shows a happy Cecilia and Robbie together once again in what could either be afterlife or a figment of Briony's imagination.</p>
