english has less letters to remember
chinese has more and more words

if use the way, remember and memorise, it is harder to write chinese.
but if use memorise, it is easier for every one to write good english

for meself. don't pay much time to write chinese
and never think

i could think
never try to remember all the symbols
or another way
need to forget the symbols
learning writing chinese like drawing.

that may be a excuetable way
i will try this 
in tranditional chinses writing with a hair pen.

let's do it, and see the result.
